<h5>Chapter 1: Of the various kinds of Princedom, and of the ways in which they are acquired</h5>
<p>	• Republics or Princedoms</p>
<p>	• Princedoms: 	</p>
<p>&ensp; - Hereditary</p>
<p>&ensp;	- New: either wholly new e.g. Milan to Sforza or joined to hereditary Princedoms e.g. Naples to Spain</p>

<h5> Chapter 2: Of hereditary Princedoms</h5>
<p>	• Easier to maintain since they are accustomed to the family of the Prince. An average Prince can maintain his by following traditions</p>
<p>	• A Prince by birth. Fewer occasions and less need to give offence, better loved, probably more popular with people (unless his vices are outrageous).</p>
<p>	• Antiquity and continuance of rule. People are less likely to have thoughts of changing it (true to some extent, as long as a certain amount of satisfaction is maintained among the people).</p>

<h5>Chapter 3: Of mixed Princedoms i.e. joined to ancient dominions of the Prince</h5>

<p>	• When acquiring a new Princedom. Offend new subjects but usually hard to keep friendship of existing supporters because you can neither reward them as they expect or use violent remedies against them (due to obligations).</p>
<p>	• Important to gain good will of inhabitants</p>
<p>	• Inhabitants may welcome a new ruler then regret bc reality doesn't match expectations. Rebel again and open the gates to another outsiders.</p>
<p>	• If rebellion is put under control, harder to lose again, need to swiftly put down rebellion and strengthen your position.</p>
<p>	• If new Princedom is of the same tongue/customs, much easier to maintain, just need to root out the old princely line and let men continue to live with their existing customs.</p>
<p>	• If new Princedom is not of same tongue/customs/laws, a lot harder. Some remedies:</p>
<p>	&ensp;- Prince goes and dwells in person, more secure bc easier to detect disorders before they are past cure, people also have direct access to Prince, more likely to love/fear him.</p>
<p>	&ensp;- Send colonies, injures small minority deprived of privileges. This is fine as long as they are scattered and poor. Need to either kindly treat or utterly crush opponents, no in between.</p>
<p>	&ensp;- Do not send troops to maintain, a lot more costly
		(Britain sent a small number of officers who administered the whole of India instead of numerous troops which the Empire could not possibly have maintained. This is wise).</p>
<p>	&ensp;- Weaken strong neighbors, protect and potentially ally with weak neighbors but do not make them stronger. Do not let another powerful Prince have entrance there. Remember the Aetolians brought the strong Romans into Greece and eventually lost.</p>
<p>	&ensp;- Need to consider problems far into the future and nip them in the bud.</p>
<p>	&ensp;- War is not so to be avoided but is only postponed to the advantage of the other side. Go to war when necessary to prevent problems in the future</p>
<p>	&ensp;- Louis XII took Lombardy but made the mistake of strengthening Pope Alexander and alienating his friends and supporters. He also brought Spain (a powerful kingdom) into his new possessions, giving a powerful rival entrance to ur new Princedom is a big mistake. If your force is not strong enough to take the whole thing, do not try to take it by sharing it with a rival. Louis also didn't send in colonies or live there himself.</p>

<h5>Chapter 4: Why the kingdom of Darius, conquered by Alexander, did not, on Alexander's death, rebel against his successors</h5>

<p>	• Two ways of governing on record: Prince and his ministers assisting (permitted by the Prince) vs Prince and his barons who hold their rank by the antiquity of blood with their own subjects that recognize them as their rulers.</p>
<p>	• Darius' kingdom was the first kind, harder to gain possession but easier to hold once gained, you need your own strength to attack this kind of kingdom and cannot rely on division.</p>
<p>	• For the second kind, need long continuance of rule, memory fades away, secure (look at the Romans)</p>

<h5>Chapter 5: How cities or provinces which before their acquisition have lived under their own laws are to be governed</h5>

<p>	• More easily controlled through their own citizens.</p>
<p>	• 3 ways: totally destroy it, reside there in person, subject it to tribute and let a few citizens run it.</p>
<p> • Only destroying it can really secure it for a long time, absent other factors.</p>
<p> • But if they are accustomed to live under a Prince's rule, then easy to new Prince to gain them once old Prince's line is extinguished.</p>

<h5>Chapter 6: Of new Princedoms which a Prince acquires with his own arms and by merit</h5>

<p>	• Wise men follow the roads that have been trodden by the great and imitate those who have most excelled.</p>
<p>	• Acquired with merit, usually more difficulties but easier to keep.</p>
<p>	• Setting up a leader in charge of change. Delicate, dangerous but important. Change = making enemies out of those that benefitted under old order and only lukewarm support from those that might be better under the new. Enemies attack with zeal but supporters defend only half-heartedly.</p>
<p>	• An innovator needs to be able to rely on his own resources and employ his own force. All armed prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed prophets have been destroyed.</p>
<p>	• Temper of the multitude is fickle and hard to fix them in persuasion of an idea. Sometimes need to compel them with force.</p>


<h5>Chapter 7: Of new princedoms acquired by the aid of others and by good fortune</h5>

<p>	• Easy to acquire but hard to maintain.</p>
<p>	• Depend on the support of others. Not stable or secure.</p>
<p>	• Usually lack the knowledge and power to maintain position.</p>
<p>	• Shallow roots.</p>
<p>	• Example of Duke Valentino, son of Alexander VI. Came into power by good fortune but was shrewd enough to take all the right steps, except for the one leading to his demise i.e. letting someone not under his control get elected as Pope.</p>


<h5>Chapter 8: Of those who by the crimes come to be princes</h5>

<p>	• Agathocles of Syracuse, from lowest class to King of Syracuse, rose through ranks and held position with violence, killed all Syracuse senators.</p>
<p>	• Power but no glory.</p>
<p>	• Well-employed cruelty: done once for all under the necessity of self-preservation, and not afterwards persisted in. Decent chance of being able to maintain power if smart enough.</p>
<p>	• Ill-employed cruelty: small at first then increase over time. Cannot maintain power for long.</p>
<p>	• Sweeping and harsh punishment upon seizing power to crush enemies but no more after.</p>
<p></p>

<h5>Chapter 9: Of the civil Princedom</h5>
<p>Civil Princedom: Prince comes to power by favour of fellow citizens, either through the people or nobles.</p>
<p>2 opposing tendencies: people to hate oppression by nobles and nobles to dominate over people.</p>
<p>3 results: a Princedom, or Liberty, or License.</p>
<p>Princedom: created by either people or nobles. If nobles think they cannot withstand people, they elevate one of their number
and make him Prince so they can indulge their desires under his shadow. If people see they cannot win against nobles, they invest all authority
and influence in Prince so they can have shelter.</p>
<p>Becoming Prince through favor of nobles harder to maintain position compared to through people. Nobles think they are as good as him or better so hard to govern.
Nobles also usually tend to see oppression, make more enemies eventually, not good. Most importantly, people have advantage in number.</p>
<p> Nobles are usually more crafty and have great influence, greater injuries when they turn against Prince.</p>
<p>Nobles that bind to Prince, easier to maintain. Those that do not, usually think of themselves first. But usually they lack courage.</p>
<p>If Prince came to power through favor of people, easy to maintain: just don't oppress them too much</p>
<p>If made Prince through nobles, also conciliate people. People are your resources in adversity.</p>
<p>Example of Nabis of Sparta.</p>
<p>Need to be able to inspire the people.</p>
<p>Do not assume what you see in peace will hold in a war.</p>
<p>Need to make the State and Prince indispensable to people in both times to have long term security.</p>

<h5>Chapter 10: How the strength of all Princedoms should be measured </h5>
<p>Two kinds: those that can stand on their own and those that need outside help.</p>
<p>For second kind, fortify town in which Prince lives and make sure he has popular support, perhaps ignore the country outside, enemies will think twice before attacking.</p>
<p>In difficult times, hold out hope that difficulties will not continue for long, excite fears of enemies' cruelty, silence those who are too forward with complaints,
take advantage of the people's highly emotional state.</p>

<h5>Chapter 11: Of ecclesiastical Princedoms</h5>
<p>Prince's authority is secured through religion.</p>

<h5>Chapter 12: How many different kinds of soldiers there are, and of mercenaries</h5>
<p>Main foundations of a state: good laws and good arms. Cannot have good laws without good arms, likely to have good laws with good arms.
Thus extremely important to have good arms.</p>
<p>Arms: either through his own subjects, mercenaries or auxiliaries, or mix. Do not trust mercenaries, not brave and inspired enough when needed and have their own ambitions.</p>
<p>Extremely important to build up your own arms and not rely on others.</p>

<h5>Chapter 13: Of auxiliary, mixed, and national arms</h5>
<p>Auxiliary: roops brought in by another ruler. Cannot entrust your life to them. If they lose, you die. If they win, you're their prisoner.</p>
<p>Greatest danger from mercenaries is inertness and cowardice, from auxiliaries their valor.</p>
<p>Important cause of decline of Roman empire is employment of Gothic mercenaries.</p>
<p>Again, extremely important to have your own well-trained, loyal and inspired armed forced.</p>

<h5>Chapter 14: Of the duty of a Prince in respect of military affairs</h5>
<p>Art of war is of utmost important to Princes. Neglect = likely demise, proficiency = likely rise to power. </p>
<p>Prince ignorant of art of war not respected by his soliders and cannot trust them.</p>
<p>Keep soldiers well-trained and disciplined. Engage yourself in battles to learn, of strategies and of places and what can be used in each situation.</p>
<p>Read history, note actions of great men and their conduct, examine victories and defeats.</p>
<p>Never stop, always prepare yourself</p>

<h5>Chapter 15: Of the qualities in respect of which men, and most of all Princes, are praised or blamed</h5>
<p>Way in which we live vastly different from way in which we supposedly ought to live. Realist vs idealist</p>
<p>There may a course filled with appearance of vice that Prince should take instead of the supposedly virtuous one.</p>

<h5>Of liberality and miserliness</h5>
<p>Better be miserly than liberal.</p>
<p>Be miserly when you have already attained power. If you are seeking power, 'appear' as if you are liberal. </p>
<p>Be miserly with your own resources, but liberal with those acquired from others.</p>
<p>Add to your reputation without hurting yourself.</p>

<h5>Chapter 17: Of cruelty and clemency, and whether it is better to be loved or feared</h5>
<p>Prince should desire to be accounted merciful and not cruel. However, should be on his guard against the abuse of mercy.</p>
<p>In many cases, cruelty can prevent bloodshed and in the end be more merciful.</p>
<p>Balance between kindliness and distrust.</p>
<p>A Prince should wish to be both loved and fear but since love and fear can hardly exist together, it is far safer to be feared than loved.</p>
<p>Friendships which we buy with a price, and do not gain with greatness and nobility of character will fail us when we need them the most.</p>
<p>Though safer to be feared than loved, Prince needs to make sure he is not hated.</p>
<p>Example of Hannibal, venerable and terribly cruel at the same time.</p>

<h5>Chapter 18: How Princes should keep faith</h5>
<p>Know how to use both natures, man and beast.</p>
<p>Be both a lion and fox. Fox to discern toils, lion to drive off wolves.</p>
<p>Do not need to keep promise/contract if the other side breaks it first.</p>
<p>Example of Alexander VI promising a lot then not delivering but it worked in the end.</p>
<p>Not essential and may be hurtful for Prince to have all the good qualities but he must appear to have them.</p>
<p>Everyone can see what you seem but few know what you are and few dare to oppose the opinion of the majority.</p>

<h5>Chapter 19: That a Prince should seek to escape contempt and hatred</h5>
<p>Do not touch subjects' honor and property. This allows them to live contentedly.</p>
<p>Need to at least appear great, courageous, wise and strong.</p>
<p>A respected Prince is much harder to conspire against and attack.</p>
<p>Prince should devolve on others matters that entail responsibility, and reserve to themselves those that relate to grace and favour.</p>
<p>Example of Roman emperors. Soldiers vs people, hard to satisfy both.</p>
<p>Marcus was fine because he inherited the empire and had great virtues which kept him from being hated.</p>
<p>Pertinax chosen emperor by people against soldiers, tried to enact stricter discipline in army so inucrred their wrath.</p>
<p>Alexander seemed too effeminate, appeared to be ruled by his mother, soldiers' contempt.</p>
<p>Commodus, Sverus and Caracalla, cruel and rapacious, satisfied the solidery by inflicting wrong on people. Severus, however, was able to reamined admirable in both soldiers' and people's eye.</p>
<p>Example of how Severus was able to keep the empire.</p>
<p>For a new Prince, borrow from Severus to build foundation and from Marcus to maintain and make it glorious once established.</p>

<h5>Chapter 20: Whether fortresses, and certain other expedients to which Princes often have recourse, are profitable or hurtful</h5>
<p>For a new Prince, arm your subjects and treat those you arm with favour.</p>
<p>Disarming your subjects show you distrust them.</p>
<p>For a old Prince that acquires a new state makes it part of his dominions, disarm inhabitants, make sure arms are under his old soldiers.</p>
<p>Skillfully promote hostility in some places then crush it sometimes so as to enhance your greatness.</p>
<p>Best fortress is in not being hated by your subjects.</p>

<h5>Chapter 21: How a Prince should bear himself so as to acquire reputation</h5>
<p>Undertake great enterprises and give striking proofs of your ability to enhance reputation.</p>
<p>Inspire a sense of greatness and goodness.</p>
<p>Most of the time, don't stand neutral in a conflict, especially when combatants are of limited strength.</p>
<p>Never join one stronger than yourself in attacking others, unless by absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage, and in accepting a less evil as a good.</p>
<p>Maintain the dignity of your station.</p>

<h5>Chapter 22: Of the secretaries of Princes</h5>
<p>The character and sagacity of a Prince is shown by what sort of men he has about him.</p>
<p>If a minister is thinking more of himself than of you then he can never be a good, trustworthy minister.</p>
<p>To keep a good minister, bind him by benefits but make him dread greater responsibilities that he does not attempt to take over.</p>

<h5>Chapter 23: That flatterers should be shunned</h5>
<p>A prudent Prince choose some good men and allow them to freely speak freely their thoughts on matter he asks, but on none other. </p>
<p>Good counsels have their origin in the prudence of the Prince.</p>

<h5>Chapter 24: Why the Princes of Italy have lost their states</h5>

<h5>Chapter 25: What fortune can effect in human affairs, and how she may be withstood</h5>
<p>Fortune changes and men stand fixed in their old ways. They are prosperous so long as there is congruity between them, and the reverse when there is not.</p>
<p>Perhaps, better to be impetuous than cautious.</p>

<h5>Chapter 26: An exhortation to liberate Italy from the barbarians</h5>
