<h5>The Economic Case</h5>
<p>The full importance of infrastructure investment is only now starting to be properly recognised. For infrastructure plays a fundamental role in developed and developing countries alike in economic growth. Infrastructure investment is important on a number of levels. It is a vital facilitator of, and often an active catalyst for, economic and social progress, with the ability to transform a country’s welfare and development.</p>
<p>The overwhelming evidence from quantitative analyses is that infrastructure investment can exert a powerful positive influence on both aggregate demand and aggregate supply, and thereby help developing economies spring the so-called ‘Middle-Income Trap’.</p>
<p>Benefits to economic growth and development can be broader and more enduring than just short-term demand management and additions to an economy’s capital stock. For example: Good infrastructure can reduce the costs of production, enhance competition, expand trade, encourage economies of scale and the division of labour, foster the diffusion of new technologies, encourage better organisational practices, and provide access to raw materials and other resources.</p>
<p>Evaluating its precise impact is complicated: influences vary from country to country and sector to sector.</p>
<p>The development of energy, water, transportation, and telecom assets can all exert significant positive effects. Energy infrastructure has the most powerful impact on the output and productivity of all these sub-categories.</p>
<p>Quantity is only part of the story − much hangs on efficiency of implementation and institutional arrangements. Unfortunately, emerging market (EM) infrastructure strategies have, so far at least, proved rare. They have lacked coherence, and there has been a tendency to focus on new, large-scale, prestige energy and transport projects which, while doubtless impressive to behold, have frequently been beset by corruption and have provided limited employment benefits.</p>
<p>Operation and maintenance also play a key role in successful infrastructure programmes by extending the lifespan of the existing capital stock and thereby reducing the new for new gross investment.</p>
<h5>Global and Regional Requirements</h5>
<p>Emerging countries’ infrastructure requirements are colossal; meeting them is crucial to their future development.</p>
<p>Infrastructure requirements will be driven by demography, urbanisation, trade, and climate change.</p>
<p>&ensp;-The world’s population is likely to rise from around 7 billion today to some 9.6 billion by 2050, and most of this growth will occur in the developing regions.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Today half of the world population lives in cities: by 2050 more than two-thirds of all people will be urbanised.</p>
<p>&ensp;-So-called ‘South-South’ trade has been increasing rapidly, outpacing ‘North-South’ trade since 2007.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Since 1990 global CO2 emissions have risen by more than 50%, with the developing countries accounting for most of this increase.</p>
<p>Globally, infrastructure outlays equivalent to some 3.5% of global GDP per year are required to 2030.</p>
<p>In developing countries, the requirement is even greater: a doubling of existing outlays to 6-8% of GDP per year. Half of the shortfall is in the electricity sector; the remainder is split between transport, water, and telecoms.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Nearly 70% of the population in developing countries has no access to electricity.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Road connectivity remains low, particularly in rural areas.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Nearly 800 million people are without access to an adequate, safe water source.</p>
<p>&ensp;-In the telecoms sector, mobile phone penetration is a bright spot, but Africa remains a conspicuous laggard.</p>
<p>Africa has the poorest infrastructure in the world, with power and water supply the two main challenges. It lags well behind all other regions in all infrastructure sections, and the gap continues to widen.</p>
<p>Latin America’s access to basic infrastructure is good, but transport linkages remain a big problem not only within countries but also, just as importantly, between countries. And in the energy sector the region continues to consume far more than it produces.</p>
<p>Asia has seen significant progress in infrastructure access, but it is struggling to keep pace with its rapid growth. However, the picture varies considerably from country to country, and there is a marked contrast between the southern (lagging) and the eastern (leading) regions. Access to electricity remains the major issue.</p>
<h5>Delivery Change</h5>
<p>A combination of inefficiencies and constraints on the public finances are conspiring to limit the public sector’s role in the sponsorship and delivery of infrastructure assets in most developing countries.</p>
<p>Resources have habitually been misallocated across sectors, across regions, and over time in the face of malign political interference and inadequate governance.</p>
<p>A particular problem for resource-exporting countries is that they have systemically failed to sustain counter-cyclical fiscal policy in the face of large swings in commodity prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the global financial crisis the conventional banking sector has been constrained by tighter regulation, including more demanding capital ratios, and a general move to a more conservative approach to lending.</p>
<p>All this has left a financing ‘hole’ which can be filled only by other elements of the private sector.</p>
<p>Companies have long been involved in the physical delivery of infrastructure assets as contractors to governments, or to support their own businesses. But a broader application by the private sector, of both financial sector resources and practical expertise, is needed if emerging market infrastructure is to develop adequately.</p>
<p>Such resources and expertise are available in many cases, but harnessing them such that they work to the benefits of both parties − government and the private sector − requires
innovative approaches both to financing and to project management.</p>
<p>In emerging-markets infrastructure project finance and delivery are especially complex and challenging. Serious barriers to EM infrastructure investment include:</p>
<p>&ensp;-The limited number, and sporadic nature, of suitable projects – in particular too many ‘greenfield’ schemes;</p>
<p>&ensp;-Inadequate government guarantees to mitigate private sector risks;</p>
<p>&ensp;-Regulatory instability;</p>
<p>&ensp;-Lack of appropriate financing vehicles;</p>
<p>&ensp;-Investor ‘short-termism’; and</p>
<p>&ensp;-Lack of adequate transparency and data across the sector as a whole.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there clearly are opportunities for:</p>
<p>&ensp;-The institutional investment sector, both in the developed and the developing world;</p>
<p>&ensp;-Sovereign wealth funds;</p>
<p>&ensp;-Multilateral development banks; and</p>
<p>&ensp;-The multinational corporate sector.</p>
