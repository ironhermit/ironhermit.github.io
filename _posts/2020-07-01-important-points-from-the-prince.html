<p>In difficult times, hold out hope that difficulties will not continue for long, excite fears of enemies' cruelty, silence those who are too forward with complaints,
take advantage of the people's highly emotional state.</p>
<p>Never assume what you see in peace times will be what you see in a war.</p>
<p>Make sure you gain popular support, especially if you cannot maintain position through your own power.</p>
<p>Wise men follow the roads that have been trodden by the great and imitate those who have most excelled.</p>
<p>Well-employed cruelty: done once for all under the necessity of self-preservation, and not afterwards persisted in. Decent chance of being able to maintain power if smart enough.</p>
<p>Ill-employed cruelty: small at first then increase over time. Cannot maintain power for long.</p>
<p>Main foundations of a state: good laws and good arms. Cannot have good laws without good arms, likely to have good laws with good arms.
Thus extremely important to have good arms.</p>
<p>Extremely important to build up your own well-trained, loyal, and inspired armed forces.</p>
<p>Do not entrust your fate to troops brought in by another ruler/kingdom.</p>
<p>Proficiency in the art of war is crucial.</p>
<p>Read history, especially war history.</p>
<p>Never rest idle in times of peace, always prepare yourself.</p>
<p>A Prince should wish to be both loved and fear but since love and fear can hardly exist together, it is far safer to be feared than loved.</p>
<p>Friendships which we buy with a price, and do not gain with greatness and nobility of character will fail us when we need them the most.</p>
<p>Though safer to be feared than loved, Prince needs to make sure he is not hated.</p>
<p>Know how to use both natures, man and beast.</p>
<p>Be both a lion and fox. Fox to discern toils, lion to drive off wolves.</p>
<p>Not essential and may be hurtful for Prince to have all the good qualities but he must appear to have them.</p>
<p>Everyone can see what you seem but few know what you are and few dare to oppose the opinion of the majority.</p>
<p>Avoid subjects' contempt and hatred.</p>
<p>Need to at least appear great, courageous, wise and strong.</p>
<p>Prince should devolve on others matters that entail responsibility, and reserve to themselves those that relate to grace and favour.</p>
<p>Undertake great enterprises and give striking proofs of your ability to enhance reputation.</p>
<p>Inspire a sense of greatness and goodness.</p>
<p>Prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage, and in accepting a less evil as a good.</p>
<p>The character and sagacity of a Prince is shown by what sort of men he has about him.</p>
<p>A prudent Prince choose some good men and allow them to freely speak freely their thoughts on matter he asks, but on none other. </p>
<p>Shun flatterers but be careful in preserving people's respect for you.</p>
<p>Fortune changes and men stand fixed in their old ways. They are prosperous so long as there is congruity between them, and the reverse when there is not.</p>
<p>Perhaps, better to be impetuous than cautious.</p>
