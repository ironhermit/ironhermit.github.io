<p></p>
<h5>Preface</h5>
<p>“When people begin to lean toward and rejoice in the reduced use of military force to resolve conflicts, war will be reborn in another form and in another arena, becoming an instrument of enormous power in the hands of all those who harbor intentions of controlling other countries or regions.”</p>
<p>“If we acknowledge that the new principles of war are no longer “using armed force to compel the enemy to submit to one’s will,” but rather a “using all means, including armed force or non-armed force, military or non-military, and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one’s interests.”</p>
<h5>Part 1: On new warfare</h5>
<p>Man has long worshipped technology as the panacea for his problems.</p>
<p>Technology can have both destructive and illuminating effect on our society. The world betweens the two extremes, from technical fanatism to the rejection of science and tech.</p>
<p>Man has been caught in an endless pursuit of new technology, blindly falling in love with new tech while discarding the old.</p>
<p>Emergence of information tech. Most important benefit is perhaps the overall integrative effect on other tech. The integrated use of tech may better promote social progress than any single new tech alone.</p>
<p>Traditional definition of warfare is shaky. Unrestricted warfare: transcends all boundaries and limits, encompasses all aspects of life.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 1: The weapons revolution which invariably comes first</b></p>
<p>The weapons revolution invariably precedes the revolution in military affairs.</p>
<p>People are so accustomed to describe war using certain weapons or technology.</p>
<p>In the past, the emergence of one or a few revolutionary weapons could significantly skew the balance of war. Not now. Hundreds of weapons may be needed to have a significant
effect on warfare.</p>
<p>High-tech warfare or information warfare are dubious terms, not much value in describing the new nature of war.</p>
<p>Computerized warfare not the same as information warfare.</p>
<p>Many think that information tech is the only rising tech. This is myopic. Other tech places direct constraint on info tech.</p>
<p>Information tech is a synthesis of other technologies -> back to integration point above.</p>
<p>Exceedingly difficult now for one power to occupy an unmatched position.</p>
<p>2 approaches. 1. 'Fight the fight that fits one's weapons' -> throughout history, weapons preceded tactics, still extremely important to match one's combat mode with the range and capabilities of one's weapons and find more flexibility in combining old and new.
2. 'Build the weapons to fit the fight'. Push-pull relationship between weapons and combat mode now.</p>
<p>'Customizing weapons system to tactics which are still being explored and studied is like preparing food for a great banquet without knowing who is coming, where the slightest error can lead one far astray.'</p>
<p>Generation gap in weapons and military forces: closer -> easier for more advanced power to win, very wide -> hard for either to win. High-tech troops may find it extremely difficult to deal with unconventional or low-tech warfare.</p>
<p>Traditional thinking is that we need to pursuit higher tech to remake traditional weapons -> lots of funds wasted.</p>
<p>'To ensure that the weapons are in the lead, one must continue to up the ante in development costs; the result of this continued raising of the stakes is that no one has enough money to maintain the lead. Its ultimate result is that the weapons to defend the country actually become a cause of national bankruptcy.'</p>
<p>'When empires perish, it is not with a rumble, but a snicker.'</p>
<p>Example of the USSR, America may be follow the same path. Increasingly unreasonable cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>From weapons of new concepts to new concepts of weapons.</p>
<p>Americans may be leading in weapons of new concepts but not necessarily new concepts of weapons -> this doesn't rely on high tech but more on thinking and creativity.</p>
<p>Americans are slaves to technology in their thinking. American high tech weapons are essentially still traditional weapons whose immediate goal is to kill and destroy, still purely military affairs. Thinking halted at the boundary of new tech.</p>
<p>New concepts of weapons: transcend all traditional boundaries and encompass all aspects of life.</p>
<p>If this break in thinking is understood, new concepts of weapons now provide direction to new-concept weapons. New-concept weapons provide fixed forms to new concepts of weapons.</p>
<p>Anything can be a weapon.</p>
<p>Historical progression has always been more lethal power until the advent of nuclear weapons which have enough to wipe out humanity -> ultimate point -> sort of going in the opposite direction now.</p>
<p>Emergence of 'kinder' weapons, focused on paralyzing and undermining.</p>
<p>'On the battlefield, someone who is injured requires more care than someone who is killed.'</p>
<p>'War is still the ground of death and life, the path of survival and destruction, and even the slightest innocence is not tolerated.'</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: The war god's face has become indistinct</b></p>
<p>Purpose of fighting a war was simpler in the past.</p>
<p>Clausewitz: War is a continuation of politics.</p>
<p>Enemies vs allies, not as clear cut as a lot of people seem to think.</p>
<p>Why fight and for whom then?</p>
<p>'All friendship is in flux, self-interest is the only constant.'</p>
<p>Desert Storm: a plethory of self-interests under the banner of a common interest. Common interest is just the largest common denominator that can be accepted by all allied parties participating in the war.</p>
<p>'The biggest difference between contemporary wars and the wars of the past is that, in contemporary wars, the overt goal and the covert goal are often two different mattters.'</p>
<p>Transition from point type of battlefield to two-dimensional to three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Hitler (inadvertently) broke the separation between battlefield and non-battlefield elements, without fully understanding its evolutionary significance.</p>
<p>Modern battlefield -> infinite dimensions.</p>
<p>The expansion of the non-natural, non-physical aspect of war.</p>
<p>Combinatin of conventional space and 'technological' space -> unprecedented battlefield.</p>
<p>Battle and non-battle spaces merging. The battlefield is everywhere now.</p>
<p>'The era of strong and brave soliders who are heroic defenders of the nation has already passed.'</p>
<p>Digital fighter slowly taking over the role played by 'blood and iron' warriors.</p>
<p>Difficult for national forces constrained by rules to gain the upper hand over non-state organizations bound by none.</p>
<p>The concept of war participants increasingly blurred.</p>
<p>Trade war, financial war, new terror war, ecological war, psychological war, smuggling, media, drug, network, technological, fabrication, resources warfare, economnic aid,
cultural, international laws, etc.</p>
<p>'A national force, no matter how powerful, will find it difficult to gain the upper hand in a game that has no rules.'</p>


<p><b>Chapter 3: A classic that deviates from the classics</b></p>
<p>Desert Storm was not a typical war, huge significance (may be a classic) for future warfare.</p>
<p>Iraq perhaps miscalculated potential reactions, thinking it may be similar to Iran's taking of American hostages in 1979.</p>
<p>Common concerns about their own self-interests connect Western and Arab powers.</p>
<p>Justice was the banner which overcame Arabs' religious complex. Saddam thoroughly isolated. Appearance of legitimacy and support from a big international alliance -> easier to get people to accept it.</p>
<p>Opening another era of fluid alliances, alliances built on self-interests (technically it has always been the case in the modern period, ideology may have given the appearance of importance during the Cold War but for most countries,
  national interests were perhaps the underlying motivation all along), realpolitik.</p>
<p>DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 (Goldwater-Nicols Act), Gulf War the first (and very timely) test of the act, contractual mentality of people in legal society represented by the US, Act recombined authority that was dispersed among different service branches.</p>
<p>Air tasking order (ATO)</p>
<p>A lot of times, thinking lags behind acting.</p>
<p>Significance of helicopter force underappreciated.</p>
<p>Influence of media during the Gulf War, cleverly cloaked as objective reporting.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 4: What do Americans gain by touching the elephant?</b></p>
<p>Separation between the military branches still a big problem, different perspectives, different motivations, problem of unity of plans and authority.</p>
<p>Budgetary struggles between branches.</p>
<p>American military's extravagance, luxury style war, American society extremely sensitized to human casualties.</p>
<p>'Victory with zero casualties' doctrine, requirements for military strategy and combat skill far lower than requirements for technical performance of weaponry.</p>
<p>Gulf War, not a masterpiece of military skill but more a show of high tech weapons. This disease was spread globally after the war.</p>
<p>Rigidly infatuated and have blind faith in tech and weapons, anxious if they are not leading in terms of weaponry -> more manufacturing of new and more complex weapons.</p>
<p>Divisional system, group, expeditionary force and integrated force.</p>
<p>Air Force completed revamp after Desert Storm, eliminated divisional system, changed into integrated wings. Established Air Force expeditionary force.</p>
<p>Naval expeditionary force. Sea superiority and effective combat in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Changes in structure of armed forces after Gulf War had far reaching effects on weapons and tactics, and America's national strategy.</p>
<p>Small-scale, flexible, quick expeditionary force very effective and convenient.</p>
<p>American military theory is behind relative to its own advanced military technology.</p>
<p>Concept of joint campaign and total dimensional war.</p>
<p>Join campaign: centralized command, equality of armed forces, complete unification, total depth while doing battle.</p>
<p>Concept of total dimensional war proposed but then scrapped.</p>

<h5>Part 2: A discussion of new methods of operation</h5>
<p>'Observing, considering and resolving problems from the point of view of tech is typical American thinking'. The thinking that military technology revolution is the entirety of military revolution.</p>
<p>The highest embodiment and final completion of military revolution is summed up in the revolution of military thought (fight forms and methods).</p>
<p>Traditonal motivations behind and methods through which war is conducted no longer adequately describe modern course of war.</p>
<p>Traditional concept of territorial domain to view of the interest domain of the nation.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 5: New methodology of war games</b></p>
<p>'The American soldier always locks his own field of vision in th range covered by war clouds.'</p>
<p>Almost no unified strategy and command structure to deal with new, much broader threats.</p>
<p>'The winner likes to coast on the path of victory.'</p>
<p>Definition of modern warfare: forcing the enemy to satisfy one's own interests.</p>
<p>War has been the 'cleaner' of the ecological chain of society but also a threat facing the survival of mankind.</p>
<p>In recent history, there have been concerted, 'international' efforts to reduce wars and bloodshed through a number of mechanisms. However, local wars still break out here and there e.g. Rwanda, Bohei, Chechen, Congo, Kosovo.</p>
<p>The establishment of international rules: small nations hope to use the rules to protect their own interests, large nations attempt to utilize the rules to control other nations.</p>
<p>When small nations break the rules, it can generally be 'corrected' by large nations in the name of enforcers of the law. However, when large nations break the rules, hardly any action.</p>
<p>But, 'brine froms in the bean curd'. The above is sort of 'balanced' by the springing up of non-state forces that do not acknowledge any rules. Their goal is in fact the destruction of the existing order.
 Yes, they are destructive forces to the international order but they also restrain the destruction of order by large nations.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of bin Laden (remember this was written before 9/11).</p>
<p>Financial 'terrorists', the speculators e.g. Soros.</p>
<p>Charateristics of terrorism: transnational, concealed, without rules, tremendously destructive.</p>
<p>'Most ideal method of operation for dealing with an enemy who pays no regard to the rules is just being to break through the rules.'</p>
<p>Proper combination of different factors strengthen warfare capabilities tremendously</p>
<p>Example of Battle of Muye where King Wu of Zhou defeated King Zhou of Shang who vastly outnumbered him, through combinations of different kinds of troops.</p>
<p>Example of Battle of Gaugamela (Arbela) in 331 BC where Alexander defeated Darius III even though he was vastly outnumbered. Near modern day Dohuk, Iraqi Kurdistan. Amazing battle.</p>
<p>Example of Gustave, King of Sweden and Napoleon.</p>
<p>Now there is a need to combine all the means available, not just limited to weapons, technology or battlefield formations.</p>
<p>Combination vs addition.</p>
<p>Without thorough thought, there can be no revolution.</p>
<p>'War is the most typical game, and yet it is often not susceptible to the theories of classical games. War is intrinsically the irrational behavior of man, and based on the various conjectures of the “rational man,” it naturally and easily fails.'</p>

<p><b>Chapter 6: Seeking rules of victory: the force moves away from the point of the enemy's attack</b></p>
<p>The golden rule (ratio) - 0.618. Showed up throughout history, in many military campaigns. Maybe a bit a stretch here.</p>
<p>'Side-principal' relationship. Modifier vs modified in grammar for example. Side element often plays directing role.'Opposed to all forms of parallel placement, balance, symmetry, being all-encompassing, and smoothness, but, instead, advocates using the sword to cut the side'</p>
<p>Examples of Battle of Changshao and Battle of Cannae. Cannae is perhaps one of the greatest battles ever, worth studying.</p>
<p>'Only by avoiding frontal collisions will it be possible for your sword to cut apart things without being damaged.'</p>

<p><b>Chapter 7: Ten thousand methods combined as one: combinations that transcend boundaries.</b></p>
<p>Machiavelli's thought of using all means to achieve an objective, without restraint.</p>
<p>'“The rules of victory cannot guarantee that victory will drop like ripe fruit into a basket. It still needs a skilled hand to pluck it. That hand is the concept of “going beyond limits,” surpassing all boundaries and conforming with the laws of victory when conducting warfare with combinations. Thus we obtain a complete concept, a completely new method of warfare called “modified combined war that goes beyond limits.”'</p>
<p>Nation state is the highest form of the concept of security.</p>
<p>The existence, profliferation and increasing influence of regional groups, multinational organizations or non-state organizations. Great power politics yielding some to supra national politics.</p>
<p>Supra national combinations an essential factor of warfare that exceeds limits.</p>
<p>Historically, US always tried to get as many international supporters as possible.</p>
<p>US used IMF as a means to forcefully gain unrestricted access to Korean capital markets after 1997 crisis.</p>
<p>Supra tier, supra means, supra domain and supral national combinations.</p>
<p>Something can be a means at one level but an objective one level down and vice versa. Everything can be considered a means.</p>
<p>“Victory’s an accumulation, and so is defeat.”</p>
<p>“We do not believe that all wars must gradually progress in level-by-level sequence, accumulating until a fateful moment of destiny is reached. We believe that moment is something which can be created. Finding a way by which we can continuously create that moment and not wait for the accumulation, and then fixing that method as a kind of strategy, that is the thing which we should do.”</p>
<p>“In warfare and non-military warfare which is primarily national and supra-national, there is no territory which cannot be surpassed; there is no means which cannot be used in the war; and there is no territory and method which cannot be used in combination. The applicability of the actions of war to the trend of globalization is manifested in the word “beyond.” This word is sufficient to mean using one to apply to ten thousand, but what we mean by ten thousand methods combined as one is precisely covered by the word “beyond.” It must be pointed out once again that combined war that goes beyond limits is first of all a way of thinking, and only afterwards is it a method.”</p>
<p>War policy -> strategic -> operational/campaign -> tactical</p>
<p><b>Chapter 8: Essential principles</b></p>
<p>Omnidirectionality - 360 degree observation and designed, combined use of all related factors.</p>
<p>Synchrony - conducting actions in different spaces within the same period of time.</p>
<p>Limited objectives - setting a compass to guide action within an acceptable range for the measures.</p>
<p>Unlimited measures - the trend is toward unrestricted employment of measures, but restricted to the accomplishment of limited objectives.</p>
<p>Asymmetry - following the train of thought opposite to the balance/symmetry and develop combat action on that line.</p>
<p>Minimal consumption - using the least amount of resources to accomplish an objective.</p>
<p>Multidimensional coordination - all spheres, military or non-military.</p>
<p>Continually acquire information, adjust action and control situation.</p>
<p>“What is needed to grasp the ever-changing battlefield situation is greater use of intuition, rather than mathematical deduction.”</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>“Although the boundaries between soldiers and non-soldiers have now been broken down, and the chasm between warfare and non-warfare nearly filled up, globalization has made all the tough problems interconnected and interlocking, and we must find a key for that. The key should be able to open all the locks, if these locks are on the front door of war. And this key must be suited to all the levels and dimensions, from war policy, strategy, and operational techniques to tactics; and it must also fit the hands of individuals, from politicians and generals to the common soldiers.
We can think of no other more appropriate key than “unrestricted warfare.” ”</p>
