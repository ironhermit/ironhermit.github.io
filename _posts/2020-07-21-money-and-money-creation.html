<p>In this post, I aim to explain the concept of money and the actual way in which money is created in our modern economy, which may be quite different from standard economic doctrine.</p>
<h5>What exactly is money?</h5>
<p>There is actually no universally accepted definition of money. In most college economic classes, money is defined by the 3 main functions it serves in the economy: as a unit of account, as a store of value and as a medium of exchange. Money’s function as a medium of exchange is often thought of as the most important. Economics 101 stuff.</p>
<p><u>IOU</u>: literally ‘I owe you’, is any document acknowledging and specifying a debt and the obligation to pay that debt.</p>
<p><u>Money</u>: a special form of IOU that is accepted and trusted by virtually everyone in the economy. In other words, money is a financial asset that is accepted and trusted by virtually everyone in the economy.</p>
<p><u>Financial asset</u>: a claim on someone or something else in the economy. For example, a bond is technically a senior (i.e. high priority) claim on the cash flow of a company. <u>It is important to understand that every financial asset is both an asset on someone’s balance sheet and a liability on someone else’s balance sheet.</u> </p>
<p>Here’s more Economics 101 stuff.

There are 3 main types of money that have been used throughout history:
</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Commodity money, or hard money</u>: a commodity that is ‘thought to have’ intrinsic value can be used as money, e.g. gold, silver, copper, etc. Technically, things like bushels of wheat could also be used as commodity money but they are perishable, not very portable and not rare enough, so they are not a good store of value or a convenient unit of account. There is a fixed amount of commodity money in circulation that depends on the supply of the commodity.</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Representative money, or more accurately, commodity-backed money</u>:often just a piece of paper that has little intrinsic value but can be exchanged for a fixed amount of a commodity/hard money and is endorsed by a trusted social institution. Example: the US dollar between 1944 and 1971. Roughly $35 could be exchanged for an ounce of gold and this was guaranteed by the US government. The amount of gold backing was limited but the amount of claims on gold was not fixed. Credit (more on this later) was allowed to expand more freely but there was a limit to the expansion.</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Fiat money</u>:the funniest form of money out of the 3. Fiat money has no intrinsic value and is not backed by a hard commodity. It only has value because it is guaranteed by a government and is trusted by virtually everyone in the economy. In other words, there’s nothing backing fiat money except people’s faith. Most modern currencies e.g. USD, EUR, JPY are fiat money. The evolution of fiat money in society is quite a complicated topic and has a lot to do with social and historical forces/conventions. At any time, people could lose trust in fiat money for a number of reasons and fiat becomes worthless. This is what happened in the Weimar Republic in the 1920s when inflation reached stratospheric levels.</p>
<p>We now move on to slightly more unfamiliar concepts. To understand how money is created and operates in the modern economy, we divide the economy into 3 broad sectors: </p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Central bank</u>: an institution that is in charge of creating and managing the currency and monetary policy of a country/group of countries (in the case of the EU) e.g. Federal Reserve in the US, Bank of England in the UK, Bank of Japan in Japan.</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Commercial banks</u>:your everyday banks e.g. Bank of America, Chase, HSBC, Citibank, etc.</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Private sector</u>:the rest of the economy, mostly households and private companies.</p>
<p>Within the modern economy, money can be thought to be divided into 3 types: currency, central bank reserves and bank deposits. Each type corresponds to a different set of interactions between the 3 aforementioned groups.</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Currency</u>: think of this as your everyday dollar/pound/yen notes and coins. Currency is mostly held by commercial banks and the private sector. In essence, currency is an IOU from the central bank to commercial banks and the private sector. It is a liability for the central bank but is an asset for commercial banks and the private sector. Most modern currencies are fiat. You may think that currency makes up a large proportion of the total amount of money. This is, however, not true at all. Currency comprises a very small percentage of how much money there is in the economy.</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Central bank reserves</u>:bank reserves may sound familiar but they are actually not very well-understood by even finance professionals. In essence, central bank reserves are IOUs from the central bank to commercial banks (and never to the private sector). They are liabilities for the central bank but assets for commercial banks. Think of them as a of medium of exchange between commercial banks (which transact large volumes of money with one another daily) held at commercial banks’ accounts at the central bank. The central bank also guarantees that bank reserves can be exchanged into currency should the need arise. For example, if a great number of consumers want to convert their bank deposits into currency immediately, commercial banks can ask to exchange their bank reserves for currency (notes and coins) to pay consumers.</p>
<p>&ensp;-<u>Bank deposits</u>:the majority of money in the economy is held in the form of bank deposits. This form of money is an extremely important link in the creation of money and is very poorly understood by even professional economists, leading to a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding, especially with regard to how central bank policies would affect the economy. Bank deposits are fundamentally IOUs from commercial banks to the private sector. In the modern economy, commercial banks typically debit or credit bank deposits directly from/to customers’ accounts, without any conversion to currency. Many economists believe that the act of depositing and withdrawing currency to/from accounts at banks play an outsized role in the financial system. This is not true. As mentioned before, currency comprises only a very small percentage of money in circulation and most money in the modern economy is in the form of bank deposits.</p>
<h5>Money creation: literally out of thin air</h5>
<p><u>The majority of money in the economy is created by commercial banks when they make loans.</u> Most popular economic textbooks describe the role of commercial banks in creating money simply as intermediaries that receive and lend out deposits repeatedly and the initial deposits come from consumers’ savings. This is not how things work in reality. Banks can simply create deposits when they lend to households and firms.</p>
<p>For an example, let us say you are looking to take out a mortgage (a loan) from your favorite bank to purchase a house. The moment the bank gives you the loan, the loan becomes the bank’s asset on its balance sheet. At the same time, the bank deposits money in your bank account. This deposit is an IOU from the bank to you and is a liability from the bank’s perspective. From your perspective, the bank deposit (money) in your account is an asset while the loan is your liability. Money is created by commercial banks out of thin air just like that. On the other hand, assume you immediately pay the bank back the entire value of the loan (without any early payment penalty), the bank simply debits the corresponding amount of deposits in your bank account, thereby destroying the newly created money. Money can also be created or destroyed through the purchase or sale of existing assets.</p>
<p>Now that I have explained how commercial banks can create money out of thin air, you may be wondering if banks could keep doing it forever. There are actually limits to how much money commercial banks can create. There has been a vast literature on the constraints banks face that affect these limits, some of which include market forces and households and firms’ behavior (read James Tobin for an in-depth discussion of households’ behavior). The most important determinant, however, is the central bank’s policy. The central bank can influence interest rates in the economy which are essentially prices paid for borrowing money and that places certain limits on how much money banks can and will create. I will not discuss this rather complex topic here.</p>
<p>(I will update this post when if I find the time/need to further explain the process)</p>
