<h5>Chapter 17: Of cruelty and clemency, and whether it is better to be loved or feared</h5>
<p>Prince should desire to be accounted merciful and not cruel. However, should be on his guard against the abuse of mercy.</p>
<p>In many cases, cruelty can prevent bloodshed and in the end be more merciful.</p>
<p>Balance between kindliness and distrust.</p>
<p>A Prince should wish to be both loved and fear but since love and fear can hardly exist together, it is far safer to be feared than loved.</p>
<p>Friendships which we buy with a price, and do not gain with greatness and nobility of character will fail us when we need them the most.</p>
<p>Though safer to be feared than loved, Prince needs to make sure he is not hated.</p>
<p>Example of Hannibal, venerable and terribly cruel at the same time.</p>

<h5>Chapter 18: How Princes should keep faith</h5>
<p>Know how to use both natures, man and beast.</p>
<p>Be both a lion and fox. Fox to discern toils, lion to drive off wolves.</p>
<p>Do not need to keep promise/contract if the other side breaks it first.</p>
<p>Example of Alexander VI promising a lot then not delivering but it worked in the end.</p>
<p>Not essential and may be hurtful for Prince to have all the good qualities but he must appear to have them.</p>
<p>Everyone can see what you seem but few know what you are and few dare to oppose the opinion of the majority.</p>

<h5>Chapter 19: That a Prince should seek to escape contempt and hatred</h5>
<p>Do not touch subjects' honor and property. This allows them to live contentedly.</p>
<p>Need to at least appear great, courageous, wise and strong.</p>
<p>A respected Prince is much harder to conspire against and attack.</p>
<p>Prince should devolve on others matters that entail responsibility, and reserve to themselves those that relate to grace and favour.</p>
<p>Example of Roman emperors. Soldiers vs people, hard to satisfy both.</p>
<p>Marcus was fine because he inherited the empire and had great virtues which kept him from being hated.</p>
<p>Pertinax chosen emperor by people against soldiers, tried to enact stricter discipline in army so inucrred their wrath.</p>
<p>Alexander seemed too effeminate, appeared to be ruled by his mother, soldiers' contempt.</p>
<p>Commodus, Sverus and Caracalla, cruel and rapacious, satisfied the solidery by inflicting wrong on people. Severus, however, was able to reamined admirable in both soldiers' and people's eye.</p>
<p>Example of how Severus was able to keep the empire.</p>
<p>For a new Prince, borrow from Severus to build foundation and from Marcus to maintain and make it glorious once established.</p>

<h5>Chapter 20: Whether fortresses, and certain other expedients to which Princes often have recourse, are profitable or hurtful</h5>
<p>For a new Prince, arm your subjects and treat those you arm with favour.</p>
<p>Disarming your subjects show you distrust them.</p>
<p>For a old Prince that acquires a new state makes it part of his dominions, disarm inhabitants, make sure arms are under his old soldiers.</p>
<p>Skillfully promote hostility in some places then crush it sometimes so as to enhance your greatness.</p>
<p>Best fortress is in not being hated by your subjects.</p>

<h5>Chapter 21: How a Prince should bear himself so as to acquire reputation</h5>
<p>Undertake great enterprises and give striking proofs of your ability to enhance reputation.</p>
<p>Inspire a sense of greatness and goodness.</p>
<p>Most of the time, don't stand neutral in a conflict, especially when combatants are of limited strength.</p>
<p>Never join one stronger than yourself in attacking others, unless by absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage, and in accepting a less evil as a good.</p>
<p>Maintain the dignity of your station.</p>

<h5>Chapter 22: Of the secretaries of Princes</h5>
<p>The character and sagacity of a Prince is shown by what sort of men he has about him.</p>
<p>If a minister is thinking more of himself than of you then he can never be a good, trustworthy minister.</p>
<p>To keep a good minister, bind him by benefits but make him dread greater responsibilities that he does not attempt to take over.</p>

<h5>Chapter 23: That flatterers should be shunned</h5>
<p>A prudent Prince choose some good men and allow them to freely speak freely their thoughts on matter he asks, but on none other. </p>
<p>Good counsels have their origin in the prudence of the Prince.</p>

<h5>Chapter 24: Why the Princes of Italy have lost their states</h5>

<h5>Chapter 25: What fortune can effect in human affairs, and how she may be withstood</h5>
<p>Fortune changes and men stand fixed in their old ways. They are prosperous so long as there is congruity between them, and the reverse when there is not.</p>
<p>Perhaps, better to be impetuous than cautious.</p>

<h5>Chapter 26: An exhortation to liberate Italy from the barbarians</h5>
