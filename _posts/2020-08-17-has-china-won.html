<h5>Chapter 1: Introduction</h5>
<p>Bipartisan support in America when it comes to viewing China as a 'strategic threat' yet no comprehensive and global strategy to deal with China.</p>
<p>First step to formulate any long-term strategy is to frame the right questions. One must always think the unthinkable.</p>
<p>Americans have long considered their country the strongest, physically, intellectually and morally. But can America lose?</p>
<p>On the moral aspect, increasing demonization of China, coupled with the thinking that good will eventually triump over 'evil' perhaps leads to underestimation of the odds.</p>
<p>America needs to adapt to this new world to preserve its primacy. Most Americans are quite unaware of the tremendous changes in the world.</p>
<p>Chinese civilization is remarkably resilient and Chinese people remarkably talented.</p>
<p>Renewal of Chinese cultural confidence and vigor.</p>
<p>Yet, it's unwise for Chinese leaders to underestimate the underlying strengths of the American economy and society.</p>
<p>Chinese culture values social harmony over individual empowerment. American culture is the opposite.</p>
