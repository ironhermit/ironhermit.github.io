<h4>The Establishment of Civilization</h4>
<h5>Chapter 1: The Conditions of Civilization</h5>
<p>Civilization: social order promoting cultural creation. 4 elements: economic provision, political organization, moral traditions, and pursuit of
knowledge and the arts.</p>
<p>Conditions:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Geological: ice age or massive earthquakes could destroy everything.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Geographical: advantages or disadvantages to the development of civilization. If humans are consumed by hunger or reproduction due to harsh conditions, they do not
have the time or energy for the development of the arts of mind.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Economic: food and water security/agriculture a basic condition for man to have time and reason to be civilized.
Civilization begins in the peasant's hut but comes to flower only in the towns. Cities -> cross-fertilization of minds and creative power, some men set aside to produce
science, arts, philosophy, literature, etc.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Racial: great civilization makes the people.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Psychological: political order, reasonable common language for mental exchange, unifying moral code for order and regularity, direction and stimulus, some basic
beliefs/faith, and education for the transmit culture over time.</p>
<p>Any one condition disappearing can lead to the destruction of civilization.</p>
<h5>Chapther 2: The Economic Conditions of Civilization</h5>
<p><b>From hunting to tillage</b></p>
<p>Primitive improvidence: either a feast or a famine, little thought paid to preserving stuff for the future.</p>
<p>The beginning or provisions: those that thought about providing for the future had a big advantage.</p>
<p>Hunting and fishing: organized quest for food helped generate 'state' concept, economic provision hand in hand with political organization. Hunting was a war for security and mastery.
Food supply still in fact forms the base of civilization.</p>
<p>Herding and the domestication of animals: great food security, provides better conditions for pastoral life.</p>
<p>Agriculture and food: planting of seeds perhaps all started by chance. Man probably learnt to provide for the future from other animals. Some societies never made the full transition from
hunting to tillage, stuck in between, agriculture for them was a supplemental way of getting food.</p>
<p>Cooking: early primitive men often ate raw meat. Uncertainty of food supply perhaps gave rise to being omnivorous. Cooking made food (especially plants) easier to eat and digest, man turned more
to cereals and veggies, decay of teeth from less chewing an insignia of civilization.</p>
<p>Cannibalism: once upon a time universal practice among men that continued till surprisingly recent times (occasional modern cases have also been reported). This practice perhaps did not arise
out of food shortage. Blood a delicacy in many primitive cultures.</p>
<p><b>The foundations of industry</b></p>
<p>Fire: start of industry, light, warmth, allowed men to move into colder climate, softened and strengthened metals for tools,
fire came to be worshipped by many.</p>
<p>Primitive tools: probably inspired by other animals. Lots of tools from stone and plants. Stick was useful tool in many situations. (hoe, javelin, spear, bayonet).
Came to be looked upon as a symbol of power and authority in many cultures e.g. rod of Moses, Roman consul's ivory cane. Modern man differs from the primitive man in the social
accummulation of knowledge, but not through innate superiority of brains.</p>
<p>Weaving and pottery: weaving reached a level of skillfulness that even modern machinery cannot match.</p>
<p>Shelters came in all shapes and sizes and made from all sorts of materials.</p>
<p>3 further developments were needed for primitive man to create all the essentials of economic civilization: the mechanisms of transport, the processes of trade, and the medium of exchange. </p>
<p>Transport: own physical efforts then cattle (first by pulling long braches bearing goods, then roller logs, then wheels). Rafts or canoes for river transport. Development of tracks and roads eventually.</p>
<p>Trade and finance: trade began from comparative advantage, at first an interchange of gifts, facilitated by war, robbery, tribute, fine, compensation.
A system of barter later on (this is quite debatable, I just read another book arguing against the existence of a pure barter system in the past).
First mediums of exchange were items universally in demand. Homer's days -> men and things were valued in terms of cattle. Capital, chattle and cattle derive from Latin 'caput' i.e. cattle. Later on, metals were used
since they have high value and small volume.</p>
<p><b>Economic organization</b></p>
<p>Primitive communism: in the early days, property limited to things personally used. Land was own by community. In many primitive tribes, no concept of owning or selling land.
Sharing of food was common. Equal distribution of many goods (this whole part is quite questionable).</p>
<p>Causes of its disappearance: perhaps disappeared with civilization because it was unbiological, a disadvantage in the struggle for existence,
not enough motivation for creativeness and moving forward, rewarding the less able is hostile to growth of the group, especially as it competes with others. Communism brought a certain security to all who survived the
diseases and accidents due to the poverty and ignorance of primitive society; but it did not lift them out of that poverty. Individualism brought wealth, but it brought, also, insecurity and slavery; it stimulated the latent
powers of superior men, but it intensified the competition of life, and made men feel bitterly a poverty which, when all shared it alike, had seemed to oppress none</p>
<p>'In this aspect, all economic history is the slow heart-beat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of naturally concentrating wealth and naturally explosive revoiution.'</p>
<p>Origins of private property: transition from hunting to agriculture -> tribal property to family property. Family -> patriarchal -> property became more individualized, concentrated on the oldest male. Other members who want property would have
 to go beyond traditional boundaries and labor to claim his land -> became protective of his property. Population pressue kept this up -> individual property became norm over time.</p>
<p>Slavery: a result of transitioning to agriculture. In pure hunting communities, men altered between hunting/war and rest -> spasmodic. Agriculture -> regular work. Socially strong employed socially weak.</p>
<p>'It was a great moral improvement when men ceased to kill or eat their fellowmen, and merely made them slaves.'</p>
<p>'War helped to make slavery, and slavery helped to make war.'</p>
<p>'Indirecdy it furthered civilization, in so far as it increased wealth and-for a minority-created leisure. After some centuries men took it for granted.'</p>
<p>Classes: inherent inequality of men, agriculture and slavery gave rise to classes. The weak subjected to the strong.</p>
<p>'The class war began to run as a red thread through all history; and the state arose as an indispensable instru- ment for the regulation of classes, the protection of property, the waging of war, and the organization of peace.'</p>

<h5>Chapter 3: The Political Elements of Civilization</h5>
<p><b>The origins of government</b></p>
<p>The unsocial instinct: solitary instinct, man associates with others not through instinct but through habit, immitation and circumstances (one may not be able to do much). Anarchist instinct in every man.</p>
<p>Primitive anarchism: hardly any government in primitive societies, people associate in small groups (family/hunting pack)</p>
<p>The clan and the tribe: first form of continuous social organization, group of related families occupying the same place and governed by the same laws, many had no chiefs, power among family heads of the clan.</p>
<p>The king and war: war and chief/king are interlinked. 'Societies are ruled by two powers: in peace by the word, in crises by the sword; force is used only when indoctrination fails.'</p>
<p>(On war) 'Its results were endless. It acted as a ruthless eliminator of weak peoples, raised the level of the race in courage, violence, cruelty, intelligence and skill. It stimulated invention, made weapons that became useful tools, and arts of war that became arts of peace.
  Above all, war dissolved primitive communism and anarchism, introduced organization and discipline, and led to the enslavement of prisoners, the subordination of classes, and the growth of government. Property was the mother, war was the father, of the state.'</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The state</b></p>
<p>A product of force/violence/war which established the victors as the ruling caste.</p>
<p>Subjection of settled agricultural group by hunters/herders.</p>
<p>Kinship is primary social organization principle in primitive societies, the state changes it to domination which works best when it binds diverse natural groups of people.</p>
<p>'Every state begins in compulsion; but the habits of obedience become the content of conscience, and soon every citizen thrills with loyalty to the flag.'</p>
<p>'An instrument for adjusting the interests of the thousand conflicting groups that constitute a complex society.'</p>
<p>'The state may be defined as internal peace for external war.'</p>
<p><b>Law</b></p>
<p>Few laws in the lowest of primitive societies because their customs were rigid and acted as laws. Customs -> make responses automatic/uncconscious/convenient. Innovation -> disturbances to regularity/convenience -> only tolerated if they are absolutely required
or if promised benefits are large enough.</p>
<p>Customs + religion -> extremely strong.</p>
<p>'To violate law is to win the admiration of half the populace, who secretly envy anyone who can outwit this ancient enemy; to violate custom is to incur almost universal hostility.'</p>
<p>'Law partly replaces custom when the state replaces the natural order of the family, the clan, the tribe, and the village community; it more fully replaces custom when writing appears,
  and laws graduate from a code carried down in the memory of elders and priests into a system of legislation pro- claimed in written tables. But the replacement is never complete;
  in the determination and judgment of human conduct custom remains to the end the force behind the law, the power behind the throne, the last "magistrate of men's lives."''</p>
<p>Revenge/law of retaliation an important stage of development.</p>
<p>Next stage is when penalty substitutes for revenge, followed by development of courts. Public contests/duels in some societies.</p>
<p>Next stage in development is active prevention of crimes.</p>
<p>Fewer rights in natural society than under civilization, freedom was restricted in many ways by customs/environment/heredity/law.</p>
<p>'Liberty is a luxury of security; the free individual is a product and a mark of civilization.'</p>
