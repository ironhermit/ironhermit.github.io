<h5>2.6 The World Merchant Fleet</h5>
<p><b>Ship types in the world fleet</b></p>
<p>In 2007, over 74k vessels over 100 gt. 4 main categories: bulk, general cargo, specialized cargo, non-cargo.</p>
<p>Bulk cargo: dry bulk carriers, oil tankers, combined carriers. </p>
<p>General cargo: container ships, ro-ro, MPP. </p>
<p>Specialized cargo: reefer, chemical tanker, vehicle carrier, liquefied gas.</p>
<p>Non-cargo: cruise, ferries, offshore, tugs, dredgers.</p>
<p>In 2007, about 8000 oil tankers, ships over 60k dwt mainly crude. Below, mainly products.</p>
<p>Tanker fleet, 5 categories: VLCCs, Suezmax, Aframax, Panamax, Handy (or Products) and smaller tankers.</p>
<p>&ensp; VLCCs: over 200k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Suezmax: 120k-200k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Aframax: 80k-120k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Panamax: 60k-80k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Handy: 10k-60k dwt</p>
<p>Bulk carriers, 4 categories: Capesize, Panamax, Handymax, Handy</p>
<p>&ensp; Capesize: over 100k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Panamax: 60k-100k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Handymax: 40k-60k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Handy: 10k-40k dwt</p>
<p>&ensp; Specialized hull: open hatch, ore carrier, chip carrier, cement carrier</p>
<p>Container ships: box holds and cell guides. Ro-ro: access by ramps. Multi-purpose (MPP): open holds, cargo handling gears but no cell guides.</p>
<p>Tugs: for pulling. Dredgers: clearing ship channels and sea floor. </p>
<p><b>Ownership of the world fleet</b></p>
<p>Must be registered under national flag, this is the legal jurisdiction, also subject to international conventions and laws of another country when in their waters.</p>
<p><b>Aging, obsolescence and fleet replacement</b></p>
<p>Sell and purchase market or scrap dealer. Shipping cycle is important.</p>
<h5>2.7 The Cost of Sea Transport</h5>
<p><b>World trade and the cost of freight</b></p>
<p>Cost of freight is now so cheap but varies in cycles. About 50 cents to $1 a barrel of crude long term.</p>
<p><b>Ship size and economies of scale</b></p>
<p>EoS very important. Capesize: coal and iron ore. Panamax: grain, coal and small iron ore parcels. Handy: minor bulks. </p>
<p>Size has historically increased over time.</p>
<p>Unit Cost = (LC + OPEX + CH)/PS. LC = capital cost, OPEX = operating costs, CH = cargo handling costs.</p>
<p>LC + OPEX + CH increase less than proportionally w.r.t tonnage.</p>
<p>Liners: many parcels, smaller sizes, need a lot of staff. Bulks: fewer parcels but much larger.</p>
<p><b>Bulk shipping economics</b></p>
<p>General principle of one ship, one cargo</p>
<p>Shipper can either run his own fleet (e.g. oil majors, big steel companies) or leave it to specialist bulk shippers. </p>
<p>Own fleet: can help optimize certain operations but huge capital investment. Some choose to just charter long term</p>
<p><b>Liner shipping economics</b></p>
<p>Cargoes too small to fill a ship on their own. Regular scheduled service between ports. A lot more complex admdin stuff so very high overheads.</p>
<p>Vulnerable to marginal cost pricing.</p>
<h5>2.8 The Role of Ports in the Transport System</h5>
<p>Port calls now highly automated, less obvious but a lot more intense and efficient.</p>
<p>Port: geographical area where ships load and discharge cargo. Port authority: provides maritime service. Terminal: one of more berths devoted to a specific type of cargo handling. </p>
<p>Secure location, cargo handling, storage for cargoes, integration with land transport system.</p>
<p>Lots of competition for ports in the same region.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai in the Far East. Rotterdam, Antwerp, Bremen, Hamburg in Europe. </p>
<p>Charge in 2 ways: allin or add-on.</p>
<h5>The Shipping Companies that Run the Business</h5>
<p><b>Types of shipping company</b></p>
<p>Some large ones: national ones like COSCO, China Shipping Group, Indian govt and MISC. Japanese trading houses like Mitsui OSK, NYK, K-Line,
Korean shipping groups, independents like Maersk, Teekay, Ofer. </p>
<p><b>Who makes the decisions?</b></p>
<p>Wide range of corporate structures serving different needs and having different concerns. </p>
<p><b>Joint ventures and pools</b></p>
<p>Pools: fleets of similar vessel types with different owners and a central administration. Revenue-sharing arrangements. For ownsers, sort of like putting ships on time charter
but with variable freight earnings. Owners usually still in charge of crewing, maintenance and technical stuff.</p>
<p>Pool manager: employment for fleet, collection of freight and payment of voyage costs, management of commercial ops, distribution of net earnings according to distribution key.</p>
<p><b>The role of governments in shipping</b></p>
<p>United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)</p>
<p>Plimsoll Act (1870)</p>
<p>US Oil Pollution Act (1990)</p>
