Chapter 1: Of the various kinds of princedom, and of the ways in which they are acquired

	• Republics or Princedoms
	Princedoms: 	○ hereditary
		○ new: either wholly new e.g. Milian to Sforza
		 or joined to hereditary Princedoms e.g. Naples to Spain
</p>

<p>

Chapter 2: Of hereditary Princedoms
	• Easier to maintain since they are accustomed to the family of the Prince --> an average Prince can maintain his by following traditions
	• A Prince by birth --> fewer occasions and less need to give offence --> better loved --> probably more popular with people (unless his vices are outrageous)
	• Antiquity and continuance of rule --> people are less likely to have thoughts of changing it (true to some extent, as long as a certain amount of satisfaction is maintained among the people)
</p>

<p>
Chapter 3: Of mixed Princedoms i.e. joined to ancient dominions of the Prince
	• When acquiring a new Princedom --> offence new subjects but usually hard to keep friendship of existing supporters because you can neither reward them as they expect or use violent remedies against them (due to obligations)
	• Important to gain good will of inhabitants
	• Inhabitants may welcome a new ruler then regret bc reality doesn't match expectations --> rebel again and open the gates to another outsider
	• If rebellion is put under control --> harder to lose again --> need to swiftly put down rebellion and strenghthen ur position
	• If new Princedom is of the same tongue/customs --> much easier to maintain --> just need to root out the old princely line and let men continue to live with their existing customs
	• If new Princedom is not of same tongue/customs/laws --> a lot harder. Some remedies:
		○ Prince goes and dwells in person --> more secure bc easier to detect disorders before they are past cure, people also have direct access to Prince --> more likely to love/fear him
		○ Send colonies --> injures small minority deprived of privileges --> this is fine as long as they are scattered and poor. Need to either kindly treat or utterly crush opponents, no in between.
		○ Do not send troops to maintain --> a lot more costly
		(Britain sent a small number of officers who administered the whole of India instead of numerous troops which the Empire could not possibly have maintained. This is wise)
		○ Weaken strong neighbors, protect and potentially ally with weak neighbors but do not make them stronger. Do not let another powerful Prince have entrance there. Remember Aetolians brought the strong Romans into Greece and eventually lost.
		○ Need to consider problems far into the future and nip them in the bud
		○ War is not so to be avoided but is only postponed to the advantage of the other side. Go to war when necessary to prevent problems in the future
		○ Louis XII took Lombardy but made the mistake of strengthening Pope Alexander and alienating his friends and supporters. He also brought Spain (a powerful kingdom) into his new possessions --> giving a powerful rival entrance to ur new Princedom is a big mistake. If your force is not strong enough to take the whole thing, do not try to take it by sharing it with a rival. Louis also didn't send in colonies or live there himself.

Chapter 4: Why the kingdom of Darius, conquered by Alexander, did not, on Alexander's death, rebel against his successors
	• Two ways of governing on record: Prince and his ministers assisting (permitted by the Prince) vs Prince and his barons who hold their rank by the antiquity of blood with their own subjects that recognize them as their rulers.
	• Darius' kingdom was the first kind --> harder to gain possession but easier to hold once gained --> you need your own strength to attack this kind of kingdom and cannot rely on division
	• For the second kind --> need long continuance of rule --> memory fades away --> secure (look at the Romans)
</p>

<p>
Chapter 5: How cities or provinces which before their acquisition have lived under their own laws are to be governed
	• More easily controled through their own citizens
	• 3 ways: totally destroy it, reside there in person, subject it to tribute and let a few citizens run it
	• Only destroying it can really secure it for a long time, absent other factors
	• But if they are accustomed to live under a Prince's rule, then easy to new Prince to gain them once old Prince's line is extinguished.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 6: Of new Princedoms which a Prince acquires with his own arms and by merit
	• Wise men follow the roads that have been trodden by the great and imitate those who have most excelled
	• Acquired with merit --> usually more difficulties but easier to keep
	• Setting up a leader in charge of changes --> delicate, dangerous but important --> change = making enemies out of those that benefitted under old order and only lukewarm support from those that might be better under the new --> enemies attack with zeal but supporters defend only half-heartedly.
	• An innovator needs to be able to rely on his own resources and employ his own force. All armed prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed prophets have been destroyed.
	• temper of the multitude --> fickle --> hard to fix them in persuasion of an idea --> sometimes need to compel them with force

</p>
<p>
Chapter 7: Of new princedoms acquired by the aid of others and by good fortune
	• Easy to acquire but hard to maintain
	• Depend on the support of others --> not stable or secure
	• Usually lack the knowledge and power to maintain position
	• Shallow roots
	• Example of Duke Valentino, son of Alexander VI. Came into power by good fortune but was shrewd enough to take all the right steps, except for the one leading to his demise i.e. letting someone not under his control get elected as Pope.

Chapter 8: Of those who by the crimes come to be princes

	• Agathocles of Syracuse--> from lowest class to King of Syracuse, rose through ranks and held position with violence, killed all Syracuse senators
	• Power but no glory
	• Well-employed cruelty --> done once for all under the necessity of self-preservation, and not afterwards persisted in --> decent chance of being able to maintain power if smart enough
	• Ill-employed cruelty --> small at first then increase over time --> cannot maintain power for long
	• Sweeping and harsh punishment upon seizing power to crush enemies but no more after
