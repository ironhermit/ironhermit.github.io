<h5>Chapter 1: A brief history of oil</h5>

<p><b>1859-1911: a new industry</b></p>
<p>Whale oil used for lighting, overfishing, very high prices.</p>
<p>Small amount used in Middle East 4000 BC as boat coating and adhesives, some small quantities refined and used for heating and lamp
in China around 1000 BC, used as flame thrower in Byzantine around 600 AD.</p>
<p>Some usage in Pennsylvania in 1840s.</p>
<p>Initially, people hoped to use it as replacement for whale oil, profit from high prices.</p>
<p>Edwin Drake struck oil in 1859 in Penn.</p>
<p>Wooden whiskey and wine barrels were used to store and transport oil initially, hence the unit of barrel.</p>
<p>First commercially valuable product was kerosene, other components were discarded.</p>
<p>Oil rush, overproduction, price crashed.</p>
<p>John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil, 90% monopoly of market in 1890.</p>
<p>Antitrust laws used to break up Standard Oil into some modern day majors.</p>
<p>Standard Oil barrel, 42 US gallons or 159 liters, 2 gallons for leak and evaporation.</p>
<p><b>Early 20th century: boats, planes, trains and automobiles</b></p>
<p>Spindletop, 1901, Beaumont, TX, first big well, 50k barrels a day.</p>
<p>Discoveries in Caspian Sea, Baku, Persia, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Ford's Model T, 1908, huge demand for oil products.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill decided to make navy replacy coal-powered ships with faster oil-powered ones.</p>
<p>Wright Flyer, 1903, gasoline engine, gasoline continued to be aircraft fuel till 1940.</p>
<p>Jet engine/gas turbines, pressure differential to spin turbine, very high power output relative to weight, kerosene chosen as aircraft fuel.</p>
<p>By 1950, oil is dominant transportation fuel.</p>
<p>Bitumen, asphalt, vas, inexpensive roads.</p>
<p>Plastics/petrochemicals from 1930s onward.</p>
<p><b>Mid to late 20th century: managing excess capacity</b></p>
<p>1928, major American/English oil companies agree to not compete outside US to ensure price and profit stability. However, compliance with ratio could not be enforced.</p>
<p>Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) to impose rations on crude production in East Texas, global arbiter of prices from 1931 to 1971.</p>
<p>Seven Sisters, close ties.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Standard Oil of New Jersey -> Exxon -> ExxonMobil</p>
<p>&ensp;-Standard Oil of New York -> Mobil -> ExxonMobil</p>
<p>&ensp;-Standard Oil of California -> Cheveron</p>
<p>&ensp;-Texas Company -> Texaco -> part of Chevron</p>
<p>&ensp;-Royal Dutch Shell</p>
<p>&ensp;-Anglo-Persian -> BP -> BP Amoco (Amoco was Standard Oil of Indiana) -> BP</p>
<p>&ensp;-Gulf Oil -> now part of Chevron and BP, independent retail network still carries the name</p>
<p>Now, 6 majors:</p>
<p>&ensp;-ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Total</p>
<p>Much of oil produced until 1970s based on concession between International Oil Companies (IOCs) and producing countries.</p>
<p>Majors buy on 50/50 profit sharing with producing countries, they buy at USGC posted price adjusted for freight, a form of netback pricing. </p>
<p>TRC controlled spare US capacity which determined USGC prices which determined posted prices, often very low compared to prices of refined products.</p>
<p>Oil producing countries unhappy. Abadan crisis: 1951, Iran nationalized AIOC (now BP) facilities.</p>
<p>British govt imposed embargo on Iran, ended when 1953 coup reinstated Shah of Iran.</p>
<p>OPEC formed in 1960 in Baghdad, no power at first because production was controlled by majors and price by TRC which controlled spare US production capacity.</p>
<p>US oil peaked in 1971 (no longer true now with fracking), production declined, TRC lifted ration, power now with OPEC.</p>
<p>US dollar was (still is) default currency for oil transactions. Oil and dollar usually move in opposite direction</p>
<p>Yom Kippur, 1973, Egypt and Syria invaded Israeli territory, Israel backed by US so US seen as anti-Arab, Egypt by Soviets.</p>
<p>OPEC (mostly Arab countries) imposed oil embargo on US and Netherlands (huge trading hub), supply dropped significantly, prices shot up.</p>
<p>Nationalization quickened, National Oil Companies (NOCs) took over.</p>
<p>1974, OCED formed International Energy Agency (IEA) to coordinate response to supply restrictions. 1975, US established Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for emergency purposes. Only crude is stored.</p>
<p>There was actually no shortage in 1970s, high prices were due to government price controls.</p>
<p>1979, Iranian Revolution by Ayatollah Khomeini, Shah desposed, US embassy staff held hostage in Iran, Iran-Iraq war. Prices shot up.</p>
<p>Demand destruction usually occors when more than 4% of GDP is spent on oil.</p>
<p>Oil efficiency improved significantly as a result of high prices.</p>
<p><b>1980-1984: oil industry bust</b></p>
<p>OPEC producers often cheated with regard to quotas.</p>
<p>Saudi decided to link crude prices to finished products.</p>
<p>Huge supply surplus sent prices down, hurting USSR and US oil industry.</p>
<p><b>1984-1990: move to transparent oil pricing</b></p>
<p>Oil and oil products futures began to be traded in late 1970s, improved transparency.</p>
<p>Refinery margin netback pricing used from 1984-1986.</p>
<p>Formula netback pricing from 1986 onward, links crude prices to benchmark prices.</p>
<p>Benchmark prices assessed daily by Platts, Argus, or set at end of day close on NYMEX and ICE.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Platts and Argus assess prices during a widow of time at the end of business day for hundreds of oil grades based on spot trading in physical oil at respective locations.</p>
<p>Example: Saudi Arab Light Crude linked to ICE Brent futures weighted average settlement plus or minus a differential, differential set by Aramco each month, official selling price (OSP).</p>
<p><b>1990-2008: excess capacity disappeared</b></p>
<p>Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, prices shot up but brought back under control quickly as war ended fast and SPR released its reserve.</p>
<p>Prices mostly subdued till 2005 when demand caught up to supply. More offshore drilling from Saudi might have indicated onshore drilling had maximized.</p>
<p>Resumption of Russian production helped a bit.</p>
<p><b>2008-now: shale revolution, massive new supply (not included in book)</b></p>
<p>Hydraulic fracturing (fracking): pumping water, chemicals and proppants under high pressure into wells to break open rocks trapping oil.</p>
<p>Combined with horizontal drilling to increase production massively</p>
<p><b>Oil price control timeline</b></p>
<p>1870-1911: Rockefeller's Standard Oil</p>
<p>1931-1971: TRC</p>
<p>1971-2005: OPEC</p>
<p>2005-now: control wanes</p>
<p><b>International crude oil pricing mechanism timeline</b></p>
<p>Before 1973: posted prices set by Majors</p>
<p>1973-1984: posted prices set by OPEC</p>
<p>1984-1986: refinery margin netback pricing</p>
<p>1986-now: formula netback pricing</p>
<h5>Chapter 2: A crude oil assay</h5>
<p>Assay: outline of important characteristics of a crude grade e.g. expected yields of various finished products, density,
sulfur content, acidity and viscosity.</p>
<p>Off spec crude: crude not within a tight range of specifications.</p>
<p>Distressed cargo: cargo with no buyer, usually traded at a steep discount.</p>
<p>Reservoir, oilfields (single or multiple reservoirs related to the same geological structure).</p>
<p>&ensp;-Super giant field: >5bln barrels</p>
<p>&ensp;-Giant: 0.5-5bln barrels</p>
<p>&ensp;-Large:50-500mln barrels</p>
<p>&ensp;-Others:&lt;50mlm barrels </p>
<p>Crude from several wellheads combine to form a field. Crude from several fields combine to form a stream. Crude from
several streams combine to form a blend. Combining different streams reduces extreme characteristics.</p>
<p>Ghawar super giant field, 1948, largest field.</p>
<p>Density is the most important characteristic. Less dense -> lighter molecules -> higher yield of lighter, more valuable products.</p>
<p>3 density measures: metric density, specific gravity, API gravity.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Metric density: kg/m³, at 15°C (60°F) and 1atm, not commonly used.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Specific gravity: density of crude divided by density of water at 15°C (60°F) and 1atm, also called relative density.</p>
<p>&ensp;-API gravity: most commonly used, API gravity = (141.5/Specific gravity) - 131.5. Water has 10°API density.</p>
<p>WTI: 39.6°API, intermediate (medium) density.</p>
<p>Brent: 38.3°API.</p>
<p>API classifications:</p>
<p>&ensp;1. Condensate/Extra-light: &gt;50°API</p>
<p>&ensp;2. Light: 40-50°API</p>
<p>&ensp;3. Intermediate/Medium: 30-39°API</p>
<p>&ensp;4. Medium-heavy: 25-29°API</p>
<p>&ensp;5. Heavy: &lt;25°API</p>
<p>&ensp;6. Extra-heavy: &lt;10°API</p>
<p>Distillation profile: shows fractions of products crude evaporates into at different true boiling points ranges.</p>
<p>Sulfur content lowers crude value. Displaces hydrocarbon molecules, corrodes metal pipes and tanks, pollutants when burned.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Sour: &gt; 1.5%, medium-sour: 0.5-1.5%, sweet: &lt;0.5% </p>
<p>Light and sweet, heavy and sour usually go hand in hand since sulfur binds more easily to heavier molecules.</p>
<p>WTI: 0.24%, Brent: 0.37%, both sweet.</p>
<p>Acid occurs as waste after biodegradation of crude by bacteria, acidic crude tends to go together with heavier molecules.</p>
<p>Measured by Total Acid Number (TAN) or Neutralization Number i.e. number of grams of KOH needed to neutralize a gram of crude. High acidity: TAN &gt;0.7</p>
<p>Viscosity: resistance to flowing. Absolute/dynamic viscosity in reservoir measured in poise (P). Outside reservoir, kinematic viscosity measured in centistoke (cS or cSt). Water at 20°C (68°F) -> 1 cSt</p>
<p>Kinematic viscosity (cSt) = Absolute viscosity (cP)/specific gravity</p>
<p>Pour point: lowest temperature crude flows as a fluid.</p>
<p>Characterization (K) factors: characterize crude as either paraffinic (K&gt;12) or aromatic. Paraffinic is more valuable.</p>
<p>Vapor pressure (volatility): how readily crude or some crude products evaporate. Measured in Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP).</p>
<p>Nitrogen content: NOx are pollutants.</p>
<p>Carbon content: measures crude's suitability for coke production.</p>
<p>Asphaltenes: heaviest aromatic molecules, can clog pipes and indicate large amounts of undesirable shot coke.</p>
<p>Salt: can lead to corrosion.</p>
<p>Metals: can interfere with catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>Basic Sediment & Water (BS&W): water, dirt and junk brought up with crude, less than 1% is desirable for most refineries. Crude usually dewatered near wells.</p>
<h5>Chapter 3: Components of oil liquids</h5>
<p>Conventional crude oil: usually a hydrocarbon liquid with density 10-50°API out of reservoir.</p>
<p>Condensates: very light hydrocarbons, density greater than 50°API. Gas in reservoir but condenses when brought up. More valuable.</p>
<p>Condensates often come up together with natural gas. Separated through:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Lease separators: connected to wells</p>
<p>&ensp;-Field separators: essentially same as lease separators but on larger volumes</p>
<p>&ensp;-Plant separators: condensates produced from distillation of raw nat gas</p>
<p>Condensate splitter: very basic refinery, takes in condensate and typically produces NGLs, naphtha and middle distillates.</p>
<p>Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs): very light hydrocarbon, gaseous stp but can easily be liquefied. Mainly ethane, propane and butane. Methane -> nat gas.</p>
<p>Refinery gain: more volume but same weight after processing since heavy molecules are broken down into smaller ones.</p>
<p>Other liquids: other compoents e.g. MTBE</p>
<p>Unconventional crude: additional processing.</p>
<p>Oil sand:  also called tar sand, bitumous sand, natural bitumen. Very heavy crude mixed with grains of sand and other inorganic materials. High asphaltene content. Usually 10-15% of bitumen by weight.</p>
<p>Large deposits in Alberta, Canada; Orinoco, Venezuela; Olenek, Siberia, Russia.</p>
<p>8-12°API, extra heavy</p>
<p>Surface mining: mining oil sands close to surface, transported to separation facilities, treated with very hot water to separate petroleum from sand.</p>
<p>In-situ production: removing bitumen from well in liquid form.</p>
<p>This extra heavy crude needs to be upgraded to synthetic crude oil (SCO) or mixed with lighter products.</p>
<p>Upgrading: distillation, coking, catalytic cracking, hydroprocessing.</p>
<p>Bitumen blending: blended with condensates or other light products.</p>
<p>Methane and coal-based syncrude: technically possible but expensive</p>
<p>Coal-based: gassification then liquefaction. Town gas: small percentage of hydrocarbon released as gas during gassifcation, rest is coke (burnt in heavy industries) and slag (road construction filler).
Water gas method -> syngas: heatin coal with steam, medium btu gas.</p>
<p>Methane-based: only liquefaction. Uses indirect liquefaction/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.</p>
<p>Oil shale: fine grained sedimentary rock rich in kerogen (precursor to crude)</p>
<p>Kerogen can be heated to 450°C in the absence of oxygen to produce kerogen oil. Additional processing to obtain crude.</p>
<p>Shale oil: very expensive and energy intensive.</p>
<p>Tight oil: this is behind the shale revolution. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to recover oil from low permeability rocks like shale or tight sandstone.</p>
<h5>Chapter 4: Chemistry of oil</h5>
<p>Typically crude consists of 85-87% carbon atoms, 11-14% hydrogen atoms, 0-6% sulfur atoms and less than 1% nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, metals and salt.</p>
<p>Hydrocarbon molecules release large amounts of energy in oxidation (combustion/burning), exothermic reaction, complete reaction yields CO2 and H2O, incomplete
may yield CO, C and other molecules.</p>
<p>At stp, 1-4 C -> usually gases, 5-24 -> liquids, 25+ -> solids.</p>
<p>Petroleum gases:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Methane, 1C, gas, -161.6°C, heating/cooking, electrical power</p>
<p>&ensp;-Ethane, 2C, gas, -88.6°C, petrochemicals, plastics</p>
<p>&ensp;-Propane, 3C, gas, -42.1°C, LPG for consumer use</p>
<p>&ensp;-Butane, 4C, gas -11.7°C, LPG for consumer use</p>
<p>Light ends:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Naphtha, 5-11C approx., liquid, 70-200°C, petrochemicals, solvents, plastics, blending for gasoline</p>
<p>&ensp;-Gasoline, 7-10C approx., liquid, 100-150°C, transportation fuel</p>
<p>Middle distillates:</p>

<p>&ensp;-Residual fuel oil, 20-27C approx., liquid, 350-450°C, marine shipping fuel, electric power, industrial fuel</p>
<p>&ensp;-Greases & wax, 25-30C approx., solid, 400-500°C, lubricants, candles and coating fruit</p>
<p>&ensp;-Bitumen, 35C+ approx., solid, 500+°C, road paving & roofing</p>
<p>&ensp;-Coke, 50C+ approx., solid, 600+°C, industrial fuel for steel production</p>
<p>Prefixes (1-10C): meth, eth, prop, but, pent, hex, hept, oct, non, dec.</p>
<p>Paraffin (alkane), olefin (polyene), mono-olefin (alkene), diolefin (diene).</p>
<p><b>Hydrocarbon structure</b></p>
<p>Hydrocarbon molecules with similar arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms have similar physical properties.</p>
<p>Usually these structures are found in reservoir: paraffinic, naphthenic, aromatic. Olefin is sometimes found but usually unstable in reservoir. 4 structures -> PONA</p>
<p>Ratio of structures gives good indication of product yields.</p>
<p>Paraffinic more valuable. Aromatic content usually limited by environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Double and triple bonds more unstable than single bonds.</p>
<p>Hydrocarbons are saturated if each C atom is bonded to 4 other atoms with single bonds. Paraffinic and napthenic molecules are saturated, stable.</p>
<p>Aromatic and olefinic molecules are unsaturated, have double (and triple) bonds, more reactive, good for petrochemicals but bad for environment.</p>
<p>Aliphatic: non-cyclic structures, straight or branched chains, paraffins and olefins are aliphatic.</p>

<p>Paraffins (alkanes): saturated aliphatics with single bonds.</p>
<p>&ensp;-General formula CnHn+2, straight chain (normal, n-) or branched (isomer, iso-).</p>
<p>&ensp;-Straight chain referred to as C1, C2, C3, nC4, nC5, nC6, etc. Usually lower octane rating than aromatics or naphthenes.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Branched chains have higher octane rating.</p>

<p>Naphthenes: saturated rings.</p>
<p>&ensp;-General formula CnH2n, cyclic, branched ring or fused rings.</p>

<p>Aromatics: Unsaturated rings.</p>
<p>&ensp;-General formula CnH2n-6, cyclic, branched ring or fused rings.</p>
<p>&ensp;-More unstable because of double bonds, useful for petrochemicals.</p>
<p>&ensp;-All aromatics contain at least a benzene ring e.g. BTX</p>
<p>&ensp;-Sweet smelling</p>

<p>Olefins (polyenes): unsaturated aliphatics created from paraffins in refinery processs:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Mono-olefins (alkenes): only one double bond, general formula CnH2n (same as naphthenes), chain, branched chain, ring, branched ring, ethylene and propylene used in majority of plastic consumer products.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Diolefins (dienes): two double bonds, CnH2n-2, chain, branched chain, ring, branched ring, highly reactive.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Alkynes (acetylenes): one triple bond, CnH2n-2, chain, branched chain, ring, branched ring, most reactive out of the 3 olefins.</p>
