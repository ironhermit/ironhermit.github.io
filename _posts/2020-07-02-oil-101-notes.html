<h5>Chapter 1: A brief history of oil</h5>

<p><b>1859-1911: a new industry</b></p>
<p>Whale oil used for lighting, overfishing, very high prices.</p>
<p>Small amount used in Middle East 4000 BC as boat coating and adhesives, some small quantities refined and used for heating and lamp
in China around 1000 BC, used as flame thrower in Byzantine around 600 AD.</p>
<p>Some usage in Pennsylvania in 1840s.</p>
<p>Initially, people hoped to use it as replacement for whale oil, profit from high prices.</p>
<p>Edwin Drake struck oil in 1859 in Penn.</p>
<p>Wooden whiskey and wine barrels were used to store and transport oil initially, hence the unit of barrel.</p>
<p>First commercially valuable product was kerosene, other components were discarded.</p>
<p>Oil rush, overproduction, price crashed.</p>
<p>John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil, 90% monopoly of market in 1890.</p>
<p>Antitrust laws used to break up Standard Oil into some modern day majors.</p>
<p>Standard Oil barrel, 42 US gallons or 159 liters, 2 gallons for leak and evaporation.</p>
<p><b>Early 20th century: boats, planes, trains and automobiles</b></p>
<p>Spindletop, 1901, Beaumont, TX, first big well, 50k barrels a day.</p>
<p>Discoveries in Caspian Sea, Baku, Persia, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Ford's Model T, 1908, huge demand for oil products.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill decided to make navy replacy coal-powered ships with faster oil-powered ones.</p>
<p>Wright Flyer, 1903, gasoline engine, gasoline continued to be aircraft fuel till 1940.</p>
<p>Jet engine/gas turbines, pressure differential to spin turbine, very high power output relative to weight, kerosene chosen as aircraft fuel.</p>
<p>By 1950, oil is dominant transportation fuel.</p>
<p>Bitumen, asphalt, vas, inexpensive roads.</p>
<p>Plastics/petrochemicals from 1930s onward.</p>
<p><b>Mid to late 20th century: managing excess capacity</b></p>
<p>1928, major American/English oil companies agree to not compete outside US to ensure price and profit stability. However, compliance with ratio could not be enforced.</p>
<p>Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) to impose rations on crude production in East Texas, global arbiter of prices from 1931 to 1971.</p>
<p>Seven Sisters, close ties.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Standard Oil of New Jersey -> Exxon -> ExxonMobil</p>
<p>&ensp;-Standard Oil of New York -> Mobil -> ExxonMobil</p>
<p>&ensp;-Standard Oil of California -> Cheveron</p>
<p>&ensp;-Texas Company -> Texaco -> part of Chevron</p>
<p>&ensp;-Royal Dutch Shell</p>
<p>&ensp;-Anglo-Persian -> BP -> BP Amoco (Amoco was Standard Oil of Indiana) -> BP</p>
<p>&ensp;-Gulf Oil -> now part of Chevron and BP, independent retail network still carries the name</p>
<p>Now, 6 majors:</p>
<p>&ensp;-ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Total</p>
<p>Much of oil produced until 1970s based on concession between International Oil Companies (IOCs) and producing countries.</p>
<p>Majors buy on 50/50 profit sharing with producing countries, they buy at USGC posted price adjusted for freight, a form of netback pricing. </p>
<p>TRC controlled spare US capacity which determined USGC prices which determined posted prices, often very low compared to prices of refined products.</p>
<p>Oil producing countries unhappy. Abadan crisis: 1951, Iran nationalized AIOC (now BP) facilities.</p>
<p>British govt imposed embargo on Iran, ended when 1953 coup reinstated Shah of Iran.</p>
<p>OPEC formed in 1960 in Baghdad, no power at first because production was controlled by majors and price by TRC which controlled spare US production capacity.</p>
<p>US oil peaked in 1971 (no longer true now with fracking), production declined, TRC lifted ration, power now with OPEC.</p>
<p>US dollar was (still is) default currency for oil transactions. Oil and dollar usually move in opposite direction</p>
<p>Yom Kippur, 1973, Egypt and Syria invaded Israeli territory, Israel backed by US so US seen as anti-Arab, Egypt by Soviets.</p>
<p>OPEC (mostly Arab countries) imposed oil embargo on US and Netherlands (huge trading hub), supply dropped significantly, prices shot up.</p>
<p>Nationalization quickened, National Oil Companies (NOCs) took over.</p>
<p>1974, OCED formed International Energy Agency (IEA) to coordinate response to supply restrictions. 1975, US established Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for emergency purposes. Only crude is stored.</p>
<p>There was actually no shortage in 1970s, high prices were due to government price controls.</p>
<p>1979, Iranian Revolution by Ayatollah Khomeini, Shah desposed, US embassy staff held hostage in Iran, Iran-Iraq war. Prices shot up.</p>
<p>Demand destruction usually occors when more than 4% of GDP is spent on oil.</p>
<p>Oil efficiency improved significantly as a result of high prices.</p>
<p><b>1980-1984: oil industry bust</b></p>
<p>OPEC producers often cheated with regard to quotas.</p>
<p>Saudi decided to link crude prices to finished products.</p>
<p>Huge supply surplus sent prices down, hurting USSR and US oil industry.</p>
<p><b>1984-1990: move to transparent oil pricing</b></p>
<p>Oil and oil products futures began to be traded in late 1970s, improved transparency.</p>
<p>Refinery margin netback pricing used from 1984-1986.</p>
<p>Formula netback pricing from 1986 onward, links crude prices to benchmark prices.</p>
<p>Benchmark prices assessed daily by Platts, Argus, or set at end of day close on NYMEX and ICE.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Platts and Argus assess prices during a widow of time at the end of business day for hundreds of oil grades based on spot trading in physical oil at respective locations.</p>
<p>Example: Saudi Arab Light Crude linked to ICE Brent futures weighted average settlement plus or minus a differential, differential set by Aramco each month, official selling price (OSP).</p>
<p><b>1990-2008: excess capacity disappeared</b></p>
<p>Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, prices shot up but brought back under control quickly as war ended fast and SPR released its reserve.</p>
<p>Prices mostly subdued till 2005 when demand caught up to supply. More offshore drilling from Saudi might have indicated onshore drilling had maximized.</p>
<p>Resumption of Russian production helped a bit.</p>
<p><b>2008-now: shale revolution, massive new supply (not included in book)</b></p>
<p>Hydraulic fracturing (fracking): pumping water, chemicals and proppants under high pressure into wells to break open rocks trapping oil.</p>
<p>Combined with horizontal drilling to increase production massively</p>
<p><b>Oil price control timeline</b></p>
<p>1870-1911: Rockefeller's Standard Oil</p>
<p>1931-1971: TRC</p>
<p>1971-2005: OPEC</p>
<p>2005-now: control wanes</p>
<p><b>International crude oil pricing mechanism timeline</b></p>
<p>Before 1973: posted prices set by Majors</p>
<p>1973-1984: posted prices set by OPEC</p>
<p>1984-1986: refinery margin netback pricing</p>
<p>1986-now: formula netback pricing</p>
<h5>Chapter 2: A crude oil assay</h5>
<p>Assay: outline of important characteristics of a crude grade e.g. expected yields of various finished products, density,
sulfur content, acidity and viscosity.</p>
<p>Off spec crude: crude not within a tight range of specifications.</p>
<p>Distressed cargo: cargo with no buyer, usually traded at a steep discount.</p>
<p>Reservoir, oilfields (single or multiple reservoirs related to the same geological structure).</p>
<p>&ensp;-Super giant field: >5bln barrels</p>
<p>&ensp;-Giant: 0.5-5bln barrels</p>
<p>&ensp;-Large:50-500mln barrels</p>
<p>&ensp;-Others:&lt;50mlm barrels </p>
<p>Crude from several wellheads combine to form a field. Crude from several fields combine to form a stream. Crude from
several streams combine to form a blend. Combining different streams reduces extreme characteristics.</p>
<p>Ghawar super giant field, 1948, largest field.</p>
<p>Density is the most important characteristic. Less dense -> lighter molecules -> higher yield of lighter, more valuable products.</p>
<p>3 density measures: metric density, specific gravity, API gravity.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Metric density: kg/m³, at 15°C (60°F) and 1atm, not commonly used.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Specific gravity: density of crude divided by density of water at 15°C (60°F) and 1atm, also called relative density.</p>
<p>&ensp;-API gravity: most commonly used, API gravity = (141.5/Specific gravity) - 131.5. Water has 10°API density.</p>
<p>WTI: 39.6°API, intermediate (medium) density.</p>
<p>Brent: 38.3°API.</p>
<p>API classifications:</p>
<p>&ensp;1. Condensate/Extra-light: &gt;50°API</p>
<p>&ensp;2. Light: 40-50°API</p>
<p>&ensp;3. Intermediate/Medium: 30-39°API</p>
<p>&ensp;4. Medium-heavy: 25-29°API</p>
<p>&ensp;5. Heavy: &lt;25°API</p>
<p>&ensp;6. Extra-heavy: &lt;10°API</p>
<p>Distillation profile: shows fractions of products crude evaporates into at different true boiling points ranges.</p>
<p>Sulfur content lowers crude value. Displaces hydrocarbon molecules, corrodes metal pipes and tanks, pollutants when burned.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Sour: &gt; 1.5%, medium-sour: 0.5-1.5%, sweet: &lt;0.5% </p>
<p>Light and sweet, heavy and sour usually go hand in hand since sulfur binds more easily to heavier molecules.</p>
<p>WTI: 0.24%, Brent: 0.37%, both sweet.</p>
<p>Acid occurs as waste after biodegradation of crude by bacteria, acidic crude tends to go together with heavier molecules.</p>
<p>Measured by Total Acid Number (TAN) or Neutralization Number i.e. number of grams of KOH needed to neutralize a gram of crude. High acidity: TAN &gt;0.7</p>
<p>Viscosity: resistance to flowing. Absolute/dynamic viscosity in reservoir measured in poise (P). Outside reservoir, kinematic viscosity measured in centistoke (cS or cSt). Water at 20°C (68°F) -> 1 cSt</p>
<p>Kinematic viscosity (cSt) = Absolute viscosity (cP)/specific gravity</p>
<p>Pour point: lowest temperature crude flows as a fluid.</p>
<p>Characterization (K) factors: characterize crude as either paraffinic (K&gt;12) or aromatic. Paraffinic is more valuable.</p>
<p>Vapor pressure (volatility): how readily crude or some crude products evaporate. Measured in Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP).</p>
<p>Nitrogen content: NOx are pollutants.</p>
<p>Carbon content: measures crude's suitability for coke production.</p>
<p>Asphaltenes: heaviest aromatic molecules, can clog pipes and indicate large amounts of undesirable shot coke.</p>
<p>Salt: can lead to corrosion.</p>
<p>Metals: can interfere with catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>Basic Sediment & Water (BS&W): water, dirt and junk brought up with crude, less than 1% is desirable for most refineries. Crude usually dewatered near wells.</p>
<h5>Chapter 3: Components of oil liquids</h5>
<p>Conventional crude oil: usually a hydrocarbon liquid with density 10-50°API out of reservoir.</p>
<p>Condensates: very light hydrocarbons, density greater than 50°API. Gas in reservoir but condenses when brought up. More valuable.</p>
<p>Condensates often come up together with natural gas. Separated through:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Lease separators: connected to wells</p>
<p>&ensp;-Field separators: essentially same as lease separators but on larger volumes</p>
<p>&ensp;-Plant separators: condensates produced from distillation of raw nat gas</p>
<p>Condensate splitter: very basic refinery, takes in condensate and typically produces NGLs, naphtha and middle distillates.</p>
<p>Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs): very light hydrocarbon, gaseous stp but can easily be liquefied. Mainly ethane, propane and butane. Methane -> nat gas.</p>
<p>Refinery gain: more volume but same weight after processing since heavy molecules are broken down into smaller ones.</p>
<p>Other liquids: other compoents e.g. MTBE</p>
<p>Unconventional crude: additional processing.</p>
<p>Oil sand:  also called tar sand, bitumous sand, natural bitumen. Very heavy crude mixed with grains of sand and other inorganic materials. High asphaltene content. Usually 10-15% of bitumen by weight.</p>
<p>Large deposits in Alberta, Canada; Orinoco, Venezuela; Olenek, Siberia, Russia.</p>
<p>8-12°API, extra heavy</p>
<p>Surface mining: mining oil sands close to surface, transported to separation facilities, treated with very hot water to separate petroleum from sand.</p>
<p>In-situ production: removing bitumen from well in liquid form.</p>
<p>This extra heavy crude needs to be upgraded to synthetic crude oil (SCO) or mixed with lighter products.</p>
<p>Upgrading: distillation, coking, catalytic cracking, hydroprocessing.</p>
<p>Bitumen blending: blended with condensates or other light products.</p>
<p>Methane and coal-based syncrude: technically possible but expensive</p>
<p>Coal-based: gassification then liquefaction. Town gas: small percentage of hydrocarbon released as gas during gassifcation, rest is coke (burnt in heavy industries) and slag (road construction filler).
Water gas method -> syngas: heatin coal with steam, medium btu gas.</p>
<p>Methane-based: only liquefaction. Uses indirect liquefaction/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.</p>
<p>Oil shale: fine grained sedimentary rock rich in kerogen (precursor to crude)</p>
<p>Kerogen can be heated to 450°C in the absence of oxygen to produce kerogen oil. Additional processing to obtain crude.</p>
<p>Shale oil: very expensive and energy intensive.</p>
<p>Tight oil: this is behind the shale revolution. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to recover oil from low permeability rocks like shale or tight sandstone.</p>
<h5>Chapter 4: Chemistry of oil</h5>
<p>Typically crude consists of 85-87% carbon atoms, 11-14% hydrogen atoms, 0-6% sulfur atoms and less than 1% nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, metals and salt.</p>
<p>Hydrocarbon molecules release large amounts of energy in oxidation (combustion/burning), exothermic reaction, complete reaction yields CO2 and H2O, incomplete
may yield CO, C and other molecules.</p>
<p>At stp, 1-4 C -> usually gases, 5-24 -> liquids, 25+ -> solids.</p>
<p>Petroleum gases:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Methane, 1C, gas, -161.6°C, heating/cooking, electrical power</p>
<p>&ensp;-Ethane, 2C, gas, -88.6°C, petrochemicals, plastics</p>
<p>&ensp;-Propane, 3C, gas, -42.1°C, LPG for consumer use</p>
<p>&ensp;-Butane, 4C, gas -11.7°C, LPG for consumer use</p>
<p>Light ends:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Naphtha, 5-11C approx., liquid, 70-200°C, petrochemicals, solvents, plastics, blending for gasoline</p>
<p>&ensp;-Gasoline, 7-10C approx., liquid, 100-150°C, transportation fuel</p>
<p>Middle distillates:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Kerosene, 11-18C approx., liquid, 200-300°C, jet fuel, cooking, lighting, heating</p>
<p>&ensp;-Distillate fuel oil/ gas oil, 11-18C approx., liquid, 200-300°C, diesel fuel, home heating oil</p>
<p>Heavy ends:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Lubricating oil, 18-25C approx., liquid, 300-400°C, motor oil, transmission oil</p>
<p>&ensp;-Residual fuel oil, 20-27C approx., liquid, 350-450°C, marine shipping fuel, electric power, industrial fuel</p>
<p>&ensp;-Greases & wax, 25-30C approx., solid, 400-500°C, lubricants, candles and coating fruit</p>
<p>&ensp;-Bitumen, 35C+ approx., solid, 500+°C, road paving & roofing</p>
<p>&ensp;-Coke, 50C+ approx., solid, 600+°C, industrial fuel for steel production</p>
<p>Prefixes (1-10C): meth, eth, prop, but, pent, hex, hept, oct, non, dec.</p>
<p>Paraffin (alkane), olefin (polyene), mono-olefin (alkene), diolefin (diene).</p>
<p><b>Hydrocarbon structure</b></p>
<p>Hydrocarbon molecules with similar arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms have similar physical properties.</p>
<p>Usually these structures are found in reservoir: paraffinic, naphthenic, aromatic. Olefin is sometimes found but usually unstable in reservoir. 4 structures -> PONA</p>
<p>Ratio of structures gives good indication of product yields.</p>
<p>Paraffinic more valuable. Aromatic content usually limited by environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Double and triple bonds more unstable than single bonds.</p>
<p>Hydrocarbons are saturated if each C atom is bonded to 4 other atoms with single bonds. Paraffinic and napthenic molecules are saturated, stable.</p>
<p>Aromatic and olefinic molecules are unsaturated, have double (and triple) bonds, more reactive, good for petrochemicals but bad for environment.</p>
<p>Aliphatic: non-cyclic structures, straight or branched chains, paraffins and olefins are aliphatic.</p>

<p>Paraffins (alkanes): saturated aliphatics with single bonds.</p>
<p>&ensp;-General formula CnHn+2, straight chain (normal, n-) or branched (isomer, iso-).</p>
<p>&ensp;-Straight chain referred to as C1, C2, C3, nC4, nC5, nC6, etc. Usually lower octane rating than aromatics or naphthenes.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Branched chains have higher octane rating.</p>

<p>Naphthenes: saturated rings.</p>
<p>&ensp;-General formula CnH2n, cyclic, branched ring or fused rings.</p>

<p>Aromatics: Unsaturated rings.</p>
<p>&ensp;-General formula CnH2n-6, cyclic, branched ring or fused rings.</p>
<p>&ensp;-More unstable because of double bonds, useful for petrochemicals.</p>
<p>&ensp;-All aromatics contain at least a benzene ring e.g. BTX</p>
<p>&ensp;-Sweet smelling</p>

<p>Olefins (polyenes): unsaturated aliphatics created from paraffins in refinery processs:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Mono-olefins (alkenes): only one double bond, general formula CnH2n (same as naphthenes), chain, branched chain, ring, branched ring, ethylene and propylene used in majority of plastic consumer products.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Diolefins (dienes): two double bonds, CnH2n-2, chain, branched chain, ring, branched ring, highly reactive.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Alkynes (acetylenes): one triple bond, CnH2n-2, chain, branched chain, ring, branched ring, most reactive out of the 3 olefins.</p>

<h5>Chapter 5: Industry Overview</h5>
<p><b>Upstream</b></p>
<p>Exploration and production</p>
<p>NOC producers:</p>
<p>&ensp;-OPEC NOCs: produces about 40% of crude, price setting cartels, incentive for individual country to cheat on quotas, OPEC reserve and daily production statements unreliable,
OPEC quotas exclude condensates and NGLs as well as extra heavy crude below 10°API. OPEC cuts generally involve just heavy crude which sells for less,
thus cut decisions affect heavy crude market disproportionately. Saudi tends to cut crude to Asia instead of US or EU, thus Asian premium. Dutch disease
in many OPEC members: sudden flood of nat gas/oil wealth results in currency appreciation so manufacturing becomes uncompetitive, domestic goods prices also up, hard to maintain diversified economy.
Sovereign weath funds a solution to stabilize economy. OPEC countries need to spend on social programs to keep young and restless populations content.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Non-OPEC NOCs: usually produce at maximum capacity. Integrated: PEMEX (Mexico), Petrobras (Brazil), Rosneft (Russia), Gazprom, PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC, Petronas (Malaysia),
ONGC (India), etc. </p>
<p>Private producers:</p>
<p>&ensp;-Majors: 6 integrated majors: ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Total.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Second tier integrated: Hess, Marathon, Repsol, etc.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Independent E&P: highest risk, highest return: Devon, XTE Energy, EOG, etc.</p>
<p>Upstream support: drilling rig contractors, oil equipment providers, oil service prodviders.</p>
<p><b>Midstream</b></p>
<p>Transportation, storage and some processing of crude and crude products.</p>
<p><b>Downstream</b></p>
<p>Also referred to as refining and marketing (R&M). About 700 refineries, 90mln bpd capacity, OPEC owns most production capacity but not much refining capacity. Refineries
are expensive, usually located in stable countries close to market.</p>
<p><b>Additional participants</b></p>
<p>Energy Information Administration (EIA): weekly US petroleum stock report at 10.30am on Wednesday, reporting last Friday's inventory levels at 7am.
Also puts together market reports, forecasts and policy research.</p>
<p>International Energy Agency (IEA): OECD. Collects info and coordinates policies to prevent and mitigate energy supply shocks. Coordinated release of national oil reserves (SPR for example).</p>
<p>American Petroleum Institute (API): produces and maintains standards for equipment and products.</p>
<p>Euroilstock: stats on EU oil stocks, supply and demand monthly.</p>
<p>Minerals Management Service (MMS): manages income from federal leases of oil production areas in the outer continental shell (OCS), gives good info on hurricane shut ins and disruptions.</p>
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): regulates futures trading, NYMEX, commitments of traders (COT) report.</p>
<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): weather forecasts in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Japanese's Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI), stocks, supply and demand in Japan.</p>
<p><b>Investing in the oil industry: specialized investment entities</b></p>
<p>Royal trusts: mechanism for owner of an asset (e.g. oilfield) to raise cash secured solely on that asset.</p>
<p>Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs): publicly traded partnerships, MLPs have a management team and can reinvest and expand.</p>

<h5>Chapter 6: Exploration and Production</h5>
<p>Highest risk but also most lucrative part of the industry.</p>
<p><b>Exploration</b></p>
<p>Obtaining rights to explore and drill: need to obtain permission from both surface property owner and mineral rights owner (usually govt in most countries except US and Canada). US govt owns rights to federal lands and beyond state offshore
boundaries.</p>
<p><u>Landman: person negotiating E&P rights.</p>
<p><u>Oil play: investing to find oil.</p>
<p><u>Lead: a geological feature of interest.</p>
<p><u>Prospect: once surface and mineral rights are secured and area ready for drilling, oil play becomes a prospect.</p>
<p><u>Rule of capture: if you extract oil from land you own then it's yours.</p>
<p>There exists an optimal rate of production that maximizes recovery.</p>
<p>40 acre spacing common among wells. Within 40 acre -> infill/offset drilling. Outside -> step out drilling.</p>
<p><u>Concession agreeements:</u> also known as lease agreements or direct equity agreeements, allow lessor to explore and hopefully produce oil on behalf of lessee. Exploration in fixed primary term which can be extended
to secondary term. Bonus paid at the start to lessee, rent paid to lessee if production is not taking place, royalty paid to lessee if production takes place which can be in cash or physical crude. Share of crude lessor
receives is called equity crude. Lessor assumes all risks and costs. Minerals Management Service manages concessions for US govt.</p>
<p><u>Production sharing agreements (PSAs):</u> also known as buyback agreements, restricted production time window, E&P company bearing all costs then transfering the whole venture back to mineral rights owner at the end. E&P entity pays royalty to mineral rights owner here
regardless of whether oil is discovered. Cost oil -> portion of initial production set aside to allow E&P entity to recover its costs. Rest is called profit oil, shared between E&P company and mineral rights owner.</p>
<p><u>Service contracts:</u> E&P company contracted for a flat fee. Fee only paid if production takes place.</p>
<p><u>Joint ventures (JV) agreements:</u> all parties share costs and risks, usually for very high risk plays, also help facilitate sharing of technical knowledge in many cases.</p>
<p><u>Production contracts:</u> used for improved oil recovery techniques. Contractor gets a share of production rate increase.</p>
<p><b>Essential oilfield geological features</b></p>
<p>Three features necessary for the formation of oil reservoir: source rock, reservoir rock and cap rock.</p>
<p><b>Source rock</b>: also called mother rock, rock laden with kerogen (solid dark waxy rock). Very heavy, often 1000C+.</p>
<p>Marine source accounts for most oil, terrestrial source usually turns into coal.</p>
<table style="width:100%">

  </tr>

<p>Geological formations with common features are called provinces.</p>
<p>Sedimentary rocks containing oil are mostly sandstone or carbonates (limestone or dolomite).</p>
<p>Biological vs abionic theory of oil formation.</p>
<p>If kerogen deposit is burried deep enough, heavy complex kerogen may break down to form lighter hydrocarbons. Higher temperature (geothermal gradient, +25°C per 1km) and pressure the further underground.</p>
<p>Oil window (7,500-15,000ft or 2.3-4.6km, 165-285°F or 74-140°C) Gas window (15,000ft+ or 4.6km+, 285°F+ or 140°C+).</p>
<p>Maturation: process by which kerogen turns into oil. Kitchen: area where this process takes place.</p>
<p>Current rock temperature may be very differnt from paleotemperatures (in the past).</p>
<p>Cracking -> lighter molecules -> these move upward.</p>
<p><b>Reservoir rock</b>: must have communication with source rock, sufficient porosity to hold oil and sufficient permeability for oil to flow. Lithology (description of rock).</p>
<p>3 basic types of rocks: 1. Igneous (granite, basalt): created by heat (lava/magma) 2. Sedimentary (sandstone, limestone, dolomite): created by layers of sediment 3. Metamorphic (slate from shale and marble from limestone): created by chemical or physical changes in
igneous or sedimentary due to pressure and heat</p>
<p>Sedimentary rocks are more porous and permeable -> better reservoir rocks than igneous or sedimentary. Most oil is found in sandstone or carbonates.</p>
<p><b>Cap rock</b>: prevents migration of oil, impermeable. Could be shale (porous but impereable), salt (sodium chloride) or anhydride (calcium sulfate). Salt and anhydride less porous and permeable than shale.</p>
<p>3 categories of traps (to trap oil): structural, stratigraphic, combination.</p>
<p><u>Structural traps</u>: result from rock movements such as folds, faults, salt domes.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Fold traps: anticline traps, rocks bent by techtonic processes, oil trapped at the top of an anticline, 80% oif oil found in these traps.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Fault traps: techtonic fault lines, oil trapped right next to the fault line.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Salt domes: plug traps, underground salt movements which create pockets of impermeable rocks.</p>
<p><u>SStratigrphic traps</u>: result from sedimentation of different rock strata, unconformity traps, pinchout, lens, reef.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Unconformity traps: truncated traps, rock formation thrown upward then worn down to an impervious layer by wind/sea.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Pinchout traps: meeting of two impervious rock strata.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Lens: reservoir rock penetrated by bands of nonporous rocks like shale or clay.</p>
<p>&ensp;-Reef: special type of lens where cap rock is created by shell secretion (from corals)</p>
<p><u>Combination traps</u>: combination of different kinds of traps.</p>
<p>In summary: we need a kerogen-laden source rock that was burried at oil window depth for sufficient time and is connected to a suitable reservoir rock which is then capped by a suitable cap rock.</p>
