<h5>Chapter 9: Of the civil Princedom</h5>
<p>Civil Princedom: Prince comes to power by favour of fellow citizens, either through the people or nobles.</p>
<p>2 opposing tendencies: people to hate oppression by nobles and nobles to dominate over people.</p>
<p>3 results: a Princedom, or Liberty, or License.</p>
<p>Princedom: created by either people or nobles. If nobles think they cannot withstand people, they elevate one of their number
and make him Prince so they can indulge their desires under his shadow. If people see they cannot win against nobles, they invest all authority
and influence in Prince so they can have shelter.</p>
<p>Becoming Prince through favor of nobles harder to maintain position compared to through people. Nobles think they are as good as him or better so hard to govern.
Nobles also usually tend to see oppression, make more enemies eventually, not good. Most importantly, people have advantage in number.</p>
<p> Nobles are usually more crafty and have great influence, greater injuries when they turn against Prince.</p>
<p>Nobles that bind to Prince, easier to maintain. Those that do not, usually think of themselves first. But usually they lack courage.</p>
<p>If Prince came to power through favor of people, easy to maintain: just don't oppress them too much</p>
<p>If made Prince through nobles, also conciliate people. People are your resources in adversity.</p>
<p>Example of Nabis of Sparta.</p>
<p>Need to be able to inspire the people.</p>
<p>Do not assume what you see in peace will hold in a war.</p>
<p>Need to make the State and Prince indispensable to people in both times to have long term security.</p>

<h5>Chapter 10: How the strength of all Princedoms should be measured </h5>
<p>Two kinds: those that can stand on their own and those that need outside help.</p>
<p>For second kind, fortify town in which Prince lives and make sure he has popular support, perhaps ignore the country outside, enemies will think twice before attacking.</p>
<p>In difficult times, hold out hope that difficulties will not continue for long, excite fears of enemies' cruelty, silence those who are too forward with complaints,
take advantage of the people's highly emotional state.</p>

<h5>Chapter 11: Of ecclesiastical Princedoms</h5>
<p>Prince's authority is secured through religion</p>

<h5>Chapter 12: How many different kinds of soldiers there are, and of mercenaries</h5>
<p>Main foundations of a state: good laws and good arms. Cannot have good laws without good arms, likely to have good laws with good arms.
Thus extremely important to have good arms.</p>
<p>Arms: either through his own subjects, mercenaries or auxiliaries, or mix. Do not trust mercenaries, not brave and inspired enough when needed and have their own ambitions.</p>
<p>Extremely important to build up your own arms and not rely on others.</p>
<
<h5>Chapter 13: Of auxiliary, mixed, and national arms</h5>
<p>Auxiliary: roops brought in by another ruler. Cannot entrust your life to them. If they lose, you die. If they win, you're their prisoner.</p>
<p>Greatest danger from mercenaries is inertness and cowardice, from auxiliaries their valor.</p>
<p>Important cause of decline of Roman empire is employment of Gothic mercenaries.</p>
<p>Again, extremely important to have your own well-trained, loyal and inspired armed forced.</p>

<h5>Chapter 14: Of the duty of a Prince in respect of military affairs</h5>
<p>Art of war is of utmost important to Princes. Neglect = likely demise, proficiency = likely rise to power. </p>
<p>Prince ignorant of art of war not respected by his soliders and cannot trust them.</p>
<p>Keep soldiers well-trained and disciplined. Engage yourself in battles to learn, of strategies and of places and what can be used in each situation.</p>
<p>Read history, note actions of great men and their conduct, examine victories and defeats.</p>
<p>Never stop, always prepare yourself</p>

<h5>Chapter 15: Of the qualities in respect of which men, and most of all Princes, are praised or blamed</h5>
<p>Way in which we live vastly different from way in which we supposedly ought to live. Realist vs idealist</p>
<p>There may a course filled with appearance of vice that Prince should take instead of the supposedly virtuous one.</p>

<h5>Of liberality and miserliness</h5>
<p>Better be miserly than liberal.</p>
<p>Be miserly when you have already attained power. If you are seeking power, 'appear' as if you are liberal. </p>
<p>Be miserly with your own resources, but liberal with those acquired from others.</p>
<p>Add to your reputation without hurting yourself.</p>
