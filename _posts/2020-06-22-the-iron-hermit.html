I often think that inside me lie the instincts of both a conqueror and a hermit. I look at Alexander and Genghis Khan and Napoleon
and I see lives in the ascendant, lives so full of vitality, full of liveliness, full of an exuberance almost unknown to the modern world we
live in. I admire these lives and try to cultivate what I feel to be instincts and impulses of the same origin - a yearning to express the vitality of life
or perhaps, as Nietzsche might have meant it, the Will to Power.

I am also deeply motivated by another set of instincts - one closer to that of a hermit in
a feverish pursuit of knowledge. It is this set of insticts that led me to make this page which serves as a digital collection of some of my notes
and haphazard thoughts from my daily reading and thinking. They are meant to encompass a very wide range of subjects. As a self-proclaimed generalist, I have a keen interest
in almost everything and I tend to consciously make a (sometimes onerous) attempt to remove the boundaries between the different fields of
knowledge. It is, perhaps, an unconscious attempt to revive the spirit of the Renaissance polymaths, or conceivably an expression of my secret wish for the
eventual unification of knowledge.

As a proud member of the Church of Iron, I also post a number of strength and fitness routines on this page.
It is my belief that an ascendant life is supported by and partially expressed through a strong, energetic and beautiful body.
It is the duty of an iron hermit to cultivate both his mental and physical strength to the maximum. The neglect of physical fitness and beauty among many contemporary thinkers is perhaps a symptom
(or is it the cause?) of a society in decadence.
