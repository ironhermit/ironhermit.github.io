<p>Another spectacular Japanese work. For a moment, I felt compelled to write an elaborate review but no review would ever do justice to incredible works like this. They have be to read and experienced as if one is living through the pages.</p>
<hr>
<p>“His curt and cold ways were not designed to express his dislike of me, but they were meant rather as a warning to me that I would not want him as a friend. It was because he despised himself that he refused to accept openheartedly the intimacy of others. I feel great pity for him.”</p>
<p>“A man capable of love, or I should say rather a man who was by nature incapable of not loving; but a man who could not wholeheartedly accept the love of another—such a one was Sensei.”</p>
<p>“I am a lonely man,” he said again that evening. “And is it not possible that you are also a lonely person? But I am an older man, and I can live with my loneliness, quietly. You are young, and it must be difficult to accept your loneliness. You must sometimes want to fight it.”</p>
<p>“Youth is the loneliest time of all.”</p>
<p>“Sensei died keeping his secret from her. Before he could destroy his wife’s happiness, he destroyed himself.”</p>
<p>“A person who has been in love himself would have been more tolerant and would have felt warmer towards the couple. But—but do you know that there is guilt also in loving? I wonder if you understand me.”</p>
<p>“You are restless because your love has no object. If you could fall in love with some particular person, you wouldn’t be so restless.”</p>
<p>“But remember, there is guilt in loving. And remember too, that in loving, there is something sacred.”</p>
<p>“It is not you in particular that I distrust, but the whole of humanity.”</p>
<p>“You see, loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egotistical selves.”</p>
<p>“I was too full of youthful vigor to be contented with the role of playmate for my father. At times, in the middle of a game, I would find myself yawning heavily. I thought of Tokyo. And it seemed that with each heartbeat, the yearning within me for action increased.”</p>
<p>“As someone in days gone by might have put it, it was like introducing the smell of a Christian into the home of a Confucianist.”</p>
<p>“But men are pretty helpless creatures, whether they are healthy or not. Who can say how they will die, or when?”</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as a stereotype bad man in this world. Under normal conditions, everybody is more or less good, or, at least, ordinary. But tempt them, and they may suddenly change. That is what is so frightening about men. One must always be on one’s guard.”</p>
<p>“I felt then the helplessness of man, and the vanity of his life.”</p>
<p>“I imagined this city, the greatest in all Japan, immersed in gloom, yet bustling with activity despite the darkness. There was but one light shining, and that came from Sensei’s house. I could not know then that this light too would be swallowed up by the silent whirlpool. I could not know that very soon, this light would be snuffed out, and that I would be left in a world of total darkness.”</p>
<p>“The little community, of which my father had been a part for so many years, was his world, and he could not think beyond it. What he wanted me to do was find a position worthy of my qualifications, so that his reputation in the community would not be harmed.”</p>
<p>“He said other things in his lecture to me, among them being: “In my day, parents were supported by their children. Today, the children are supported forever by their parents.” I listened quietly.”</p>
<p>“The unpleasant feeling that I had not worked hard enough was one that I had often experienced before, though only very rarely had I ever accomplished so little as I had that summer. I was weighed down by the depressing thought that such perhaps was the normal state of things in every man’s life.”</p>
<p>“The freedom that I now have, however, is no more than an earthly, physical kind of freedom, which will not last forever.”</p>
<p>“As I look about me, I find that I really have no obligations. Either through force of circumstances or through my own designing, I have lived in such a way as to free my life of obligation.”</p>
<p>“What I am trying to say is that even then I was beginning to show signs of a deeply suspicious nature which could not accept anything without closely analyzing it.”</p>
<p>“There was, however, a certain kind of admirable simplicity in the life of the student then which one does not find today.”</p>
<p>“I may be simply repeating what has always been known, but I do believe that for love to grow there must first be the impact of novelty.”</p>
<p>“One should always be careful not to forget that a gentleman, when tempted, may easily become a rogue.”</p>
<p>“I believe that words uttered in passion contain a greater living truth than do those words which express thoughts rationally conceived.”</p>
<p>“But even now I believe—and I believe it very strongly—that true love is not so far removed from religious faith.”</p>
<p>“I came to acknowledge the possibility that the two seemingly conflicting attitudes existed side by side, and that the existence of one need not necessarily preclude the other.”</p>
<p>“stood still, unable to move away from the half-way point between conviction and doubt. To me, both seemed like figments of my imagination, and yet both seemed real.”</p>
<p>“The development—or the destruction—of man’s body and mind depends upon external stimuli. Unless one is very careful, and unless one sees to it that the intensity of the stimuli is gradually increased, one will find too late that the body, or the mind, has atrophied.”</p>
<p>“But when the loftiness is merely in one’s point of view, then one is hopelessly handicapped as a human being.”</p>
<p>“I thought that Japanese people, especially Japanese women, lacked the courage to be bluntly truthful on such occasions.”</p>
<p>“That is why I felt then not only torment but a kind of fear. It was the fear of a man who sees before him an opponent stronger than himself.”</p>
<p>“One might say that his past was his life, and to deny it would have meant that his life thus far had been without purpose.”</p>
<p>“You have no idea what comfort this gave me. My heart, which until then had felt tight with pain and fear, seemed to find relief in sorrow.”</p>
<p>“But over my happiness, there loomed a black shadow. It seemed that my momentary contentment led nowhere, except to a sorrowful future.”</p>
<p>“When I was cheated by my uncle, I felt very strongly the unreliableness of men. I learned to judge others harshly, but not myself. I thought that in the midst of a corrupt world, I had managed to remain virtuous.”</p>
<p>“I was saddened by the thought that she, whom I loved and trusted more than anyone else in the world, could not understand me. ”</p>
<p>“A woman is more happy when she is the sole object of affection—whether or not this kindness may involve injustice elsewhere does not seem to matter very much—than when she is loved for reasons which transcend particular individuals. At least, I have noticed this tendency more in women than in men.”</p>
<p>“Please understand that though I might have seemed to you to be leading an uncomplicated, humdrum life, there was a painful and unending struggle going on inside me.”</p>
<p>“To me, it sounded like the last lament for the passing of an age.”
