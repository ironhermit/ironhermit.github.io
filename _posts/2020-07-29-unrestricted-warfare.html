<h5>Preface</h5>
<p>“When people begin to lean toward and rejoice in the reduced use of military force to resolve conflicts, war will be reborn in another form and in another arena, becoming an instrument of enormous power in the hands of all those who harbor intentions of controlling other countries or regions.”</p>
<p>“If we acknowledge that the new principles of war are no longer “using armed force to compel the enemy to submit to one’s will,” but rather a “using all means, including armed force or non-armed force, military or non-military, and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one’s interests.”</p>
<h5>Part 1: On new warfare</h5>
<p>Man has long worshipped technology as the panacea for his problems.</p>
<p>Technology can have both destructive and illuminating effect on our society. The world betweens the two extremes, from technical fanatism to the rejection of science and tech.</p>
<p>Man has been caught in an endless pursuit of new technology, blindly falling in love with new tech while discarding the old.</p>
<p>Emergence of information tech. Most important benefit is perhaps the overall integrative effect on other tech. The integrated use of tech may better promote social progress than any single new tech alone.</p>
<p>Traditional definition of warfare is shaky. Unrestricted warfare: transcends all boundaries and limits, encompasses all aspects of life.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 1: The weapons revolution which invariably comes first</b></p>
<p>The weapons revolution invariably precedes the revolution in military affairs.</p>
<p>People are so accustomed to describe war using certain weapons or technology.</p>
<p>In the past, the emergence of one or a few revolutionary weapons could significantly skew the balance of war. Not now. Hundreds of weapons may be needed to have a significant
effect on warfare.</p>
<p>High-tech warfare or information warfare are dubious terms, not much value in describing the new nature of war.</p>
<p>Computerized warfare not the same as information warfare.</p>
<p>Many think that information tech is the only rising tech. This is myopic. Other tech places direct constraint on info tech.</p>
<p>Information tech is a synthesis of other technologies -> back to integration point above.</p>
<p>Exceedingly difficult now for one power to occupy an unmatched position.</p>
<p>2 approaches. 1. 'Fight the fight that fits one's weapons' -> throughout history, weapons preceded tactics, still extremely important to match one's combat mode with the range and capabilities of one's weapons and find more flexibility in combining old and new.
2. 'Build the weapons to fit the fight'. Push-pull relationship between weapons and combat mode now.</p>
<p>'Customizing weapons system to tactics which are still being explored and studied is like preparing food for a great banquet without knowing who is coming, where the slightest error can lead one far astray.'</p>
<p>Generation gap in weapons and military forces: closer -> easier for more advanced power to win, very wide -> hard for either to win. High-tech troops may find it extremely difficult to deal with unconventional or low-tech warfare.</p>
<p>Traditional thinking is that we need to pursuit higher tech to remake traditional weapons -> lots of funds wasted.</p>
<p>'To ensure that the weapons are in the lead, one must continue to up the ante in development costs; the result of this continued raising of the stakes is that no one has enough money to maintain the lead. Its ultimate result is that the weapons to defend the country actually become a cause of national bankruptcy.'</p>
<p>'When empires perish, it is not with a rumble, but a snicker.'</p>
<p>Example of the USSR, America may be follow the same path. Increasingly unreasonable cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>From weapons of new concepts to new concepts of weapons.</p>
<p>Americans may be leading in weapons of new concepts but not necessarily new concepts of weapons -> this doesn't rely on high tech but more on thinking and creativity.</p>
<p>Americans are slaves to technology in their thinking. American high tech weapons are essentially still traditional weapons whose immediate goal is to kill and destroy, still purely military affairs. Thinking halted at the boundary of new tech.</p>
<p>New concepts of weapons: transcend all traditional boundaries and encompass all aspects of life.</p>
<p>If this break in thinking is understood, new concepts of weapons now provide direction to new-concept weapons. New-concept weapons provide fixed forms to new concepts of weapons.</p>
<p>Anything can be a weapon.</p>
<p>Historical progression has always been more lethal power until the advent of nuclear weapons which have enough to wipe out humanity -> ultimate point -> sort of going in the opposite direction now.</p>
<p>Emergence of 'kinder' weapons, focused on paralyzing and undermining.</p>
<p>'On the battlefield, someone who is injured requires more care than someone who is killed.'</p>
<p>'War is still the ground of death and life, the path of survival and destruction, and even the slightest innocence is not tolerated.'</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: The war god's face has become indistinct</b></p>
<p>Purpose of fighting a war was simpler in the past.</p>
<p>Clausewitz: War is a continuation of politics.</p>
<p>Enemies vs allies, not as clear cut as a lot of people seem to think.</p>
<p>Why fight and for whom then?</p>
<p>'All friendship is in flux, self-interest is the only constant.'</p>
<p>Desert Storm: a plethory of self-interests under the banner of a common interest. Common interest is just he largest common denominator that can be accepted by all allied parties participating in the war.</p>
<p>'The biggest difference between contemporary wars and the wars of the past is that, in contemporary wars, the overt goal and the covert goal are often two different mattters.'</p>
<p>Transition from point type of battlefield to two-dimensional to three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Hitler (inadvertently) broke the separation between battlefield and non-battlefield elements, without fully understanding its evolutionary significance.</p>
<p>Modern battlefield -> infinite dimensions.</p>
<p>The expansion of the non-natural, non-physical aspect of war.</p>
<p>Combinatin of conventional space and 'technological' space -> unprecedented battlefield.</p>
<p>Battle and non-battle spaces merging. The battlefield is everywhere now.</p>
<p>'The era of strong and brave soliders who are heroic defenders of the nation has already passed.'</p>
<p>Digital fighter slowly taking over the role played by 'blood and iron' warriors.</p>
<p>Difficult for national forces constrained by rules to gain the upper hand over non-state organizations bound by none.</p>
<p>The concept of war participants increasingly blurred.</p>
<p>Trade war, financial war, new terror war, ecological war, psychological war, smuggling, media, drug, network, technological, fabrication, resources warfare, economnic aid,
cultural, international laws, etc.</p>
<p>'A national force, no matter how powerful, will find it difficult to gain the upper hand in a game that has no rules.'</p>


<p><b>Chapter 3: A classic that deviates from the classics</b></p>
<p>Desert Storm was not a typical war, huge significance (may be a classic) for future warfare.</p>
<p>Iraq perhaps miscalculated potential reactions, thinking it may be similar to Iran's taking of American hostages in 1979.</p>
<p>Common concerns about their own self-interests connect Western and Arab powers.</p>
<p>Justice was the banner which overcame Arabs' religious complex. Saddam thoroughly isolated. Appearance of legitimacy and support from a big international alliance -> easier to get people to accept it.</p>
<p>Opening another era of fluid alliances, alliances built on self-interests (technically it has always been the case in the modern period, ideology may have given the appearance of importance during the Cold War but for most countries,
  national interests were perhaps the underlying motivation all along), realpolitik.</p>
<p>DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 (Goldwater-Nicols Act), Gulf War the first (and very timely) test of the act, contractual mentality of people in legal society represented by the US, Act recombined authority that was dispersed among different service branches.</p>
<p>Air tasking order (ATO)</p>
<p>A lot of times, thinking lags behind acting.</p>
<p>Significance of helicopter force underappreciated.</p>
<p>Influence of media during the Gulf War, cleverly cloaked as objective reporting.</p>

<p>To be continued...</p>
