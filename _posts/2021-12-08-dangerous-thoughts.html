<h5>---Catharsis---</h5>
<p>I write this in a whirlwind of raw, unfiltered and untapped emotions – a catharsis perhaps similar to the kind the ancient Greeks experienced as they watched the demise of their most glorious heroes in tragedies. Yet, I find in a catharsis not a purging or cleansing of emotions – there is no such freedom from the weight of emotional accumulation. I find that an old enemy I thought I befriended long ago has resurfaced – that dangerous thought called eternal recurrence, that goddamn dangerous thought, an abyss of unfathomable darkness. Life is full of uncertainty and sorrow, punctured only periodically by moments of tremendousness – the kind tremendous enough to make you say Yes to life, say Yes to eternal recurrence even in the most painful situations. I find in my catharsis not the desire to purge away emotions but an unyielding expression of endless vitality, that inexhaustible will to say Yes, to rejoice in becoming. There is nothing greater than being able to face eternal recurrence with a resounding Yes to everything.</p>


<h5>---Sun---</h5>
<p>Lately, my skin has turned into a sickly white, eaten away by that poison called modern life and forsaken by the radiance of the Sun. Since when have I forgotten that glorious, magnificent cult of the Sun – the kind that has existed in every culture since the beginning of human civilization? I looked straight into the Sun today and invited it back into my life. The Sun didn’t find faults in me, it welcomed me back to the cult, anointed every inch of my skin with that eternal greatness and gave me back that physical vitality modernity has sapped away.</p>


<h5>---Love and dangerous thoughts---</h5>
<p>Love is such a fascinating thing. Perhaps truly understanding and befriending that dangerous thought of eternal recurrence is never really possible without first experiencing that precarious feeling of being in love. That explosive mixture of attraction, uncertainty, comfort, duty and regret capable of catapulting any man to the highest stars of heavens or plunging him to the bottom of the abyss at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>In the comfort that love provides, for a moment, the iron hermit also forgot what he was born to do and that eternal flame of passion deep inside him stopped burning for a brief second. Great men do great things when there’s a bit of discontent and unfulfillment in life.</p>
<p>What then is the mission of the iron hermit? The cultivation of the highest and most noble type of our species. The type that possesses overwhelming vitality, strength and power that seeks to express itself, the type with enough power to exact their will onto the world, to give their own meaning to life on earth, to create their own new values and to affirm life. The iron hermit does not seek the advancement of all humans. In fact, the majority of humans are not capable of such a thing.</p>
<p>What a dangerous thought! Too dangerous for this world compared to that even more treacherous idea of egalitarianism those lunatics of the French Revolution brought into the modern world! Too dangerous compared to the benign, good, polite men longing for God’s salvation Christianity produces!</p>


<h5>---Divine inspiration---</h5>
<p>I find the most inspiration to write in a catharsis. Perhaps, this is the true origin of what people call ‘divine inspiration’. And who was that lunatic that came up with such a term?? There isn’t anything divine about such inspiration – a deeply human, all too human, inspiration to the contrary. </p>
