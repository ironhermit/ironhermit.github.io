<p>In difficult times, hold out hope that difficulties will not continue for long, excite fears of enemies' cruelty, silence those who are too forward with complaints,
take advantage of the people's highly emotional state.</p>
<p>Never assume what you see in peace times will be what you see in a war.</p>
<p>Make sure you gain popular support, especially if you cannot maintain position through your own power.</p>
<p>Wise men follow the roads that have been trodden by the great and imitate those who have most excelled.</p>
<p>Well-employed cruelty: done once for all under the necessity of self-preservation, and not afterwards persisted in. Decent chance of being able to maintain power if smart enough.</p>
<p>Ill-employed cruelty: small at first then increase over time. Cannot maintain power for long.</p>
